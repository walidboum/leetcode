**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Given 3 positives numbers

a

,

b

and

c

. Return
            the minimum flips required in some bits of

a

and

b

to make (

a

OR

b

==

c

). (bitwise OR operation).

Flip operation consists of change

any

single bit 1 to 0
            or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

Example 1:

Input:

a = 2, b = 6, c = 5

Output:

3

Explanation:

After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (

a

OR

b

==

c

)

Example 2:

Input:

a = 4, b = 2, c = 7

Output:

1

Example 3:

Input:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

Output:

0

Constraints:

1 <= a <= 10^9

1 <= b <= 10^9

1 <= c <= 10^9

Difficulty:

Medium

Lock:

Normal
