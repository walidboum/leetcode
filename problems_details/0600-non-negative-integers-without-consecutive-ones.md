## Description

Given a positive integer n, find the number of

non-negative

integers less than or
        equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain

consecutive ones

.

Example 1:

Input:

5

Output:

5

Explanation:

Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.
