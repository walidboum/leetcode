## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.

Since some IDsÂ have been removed from

Logs

. Write an SQL query to
                find the start and end number of continuous ranges in table

Logs

.

Order the result table by

start_id

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |

+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
