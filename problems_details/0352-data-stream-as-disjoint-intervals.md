## Description

Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a

1

, a

2

, ...,
        a

n

, ..., summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.

For example, suppose the integers from the data stream are 1, 3, 7, 2, 6, ..., then the
        summary will be:

[1, 1]
[1, 1], [3, 3]
[1, 1], [3, 3], [7, 7]
[1, 3], [7, 7]
[1, 3], [6, 7]

Follow up:

What if there are lots of merges and the number of disjoint intervals are small compared to
        the data stream's size?
