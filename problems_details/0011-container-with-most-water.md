## Description

Given

n

non-negative integers

a

1

,

a

2

, ...,

a

n

, where each represents a point at coordinate (

i

,

a

i

).

n

vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line

i

is at
        (

i

,

a

i

) and (

i

, 0). Find two lines, which together with
        x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note:

You may not slant the container and

n

is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case,
            the max area of water (blue section) the container can containÂ is 49.
