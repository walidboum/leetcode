## Description

In a string

S

of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive
        groups of the same character.

For example, a string like

S = "abbxxxxzyy"

has the groups

"a"

,

"bb"

,

"xxxx"

,

"z"

and

"yy"

.

Call a group

large

if it has 3 or more characters.Â  We would like the starting
        and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

Example 1:

Input:

"abbxxxxzzy"

Output:

[[3,6]]

Explanation

:

"xxxx" is the single

large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.

Example 2:

Input:

"abc"

Output:

[]

Explanation

: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.

Example 3:

Input:

"abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"

Output:

[[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 1000
