## Description

Given a string

S

, return the number of substrings that have only

one distinct

letter.

Example 1:

Input:

S = "aaaba"

The substrings with one distinct letter are "aaa", "aa", "a", "b".
"aaa" occurs 1 time.
"aa" occurs 2 times.
"a" occurs 4 times.

So the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8.

S = "aaaaaaaaaa"

Output:

55
