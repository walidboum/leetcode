## Description

You are given a string

s

of even length. Split this string into two
            halves of equal lengths, and let

a

be the first half and

b

be
            the second half.

Two strings are

alike

if they have the same number of vowels (

'a'

,

'e'

,

'i'

,

'o'

,

'u'

,

'A'

,

'E'

,

'I'

,

'O'

,

'U'

). Notice that

s

contains uppercase and lowercase
                letters.

Return

true

if

a

and

b

are

alike

. Otherwise, return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "book"

Output:

true

Explanation:

a = "b

o

" and b = "

o

k". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "textbook"

Output:

false

Explanation:

a = "t

e

xt" and b = "b

oo

k". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "MerryChristmas"

Output:

false

Example 4:

Input:

s = "AbCdEfGh"

Output:

true

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 1000

s.length

is even.

s

consists of

uppercase and lowercase

letters.
