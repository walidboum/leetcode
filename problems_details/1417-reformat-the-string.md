## Description

Given alphanumeric string

s

. (

Alphanumeric string

is a
            string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits).

You have to find a permutation ofÂ the string where no letter is followed by
                another letter and no digit is followed by another digit. That is, no two adjacent
                characters have the same type.

Return

the reformatted string

or return

an empty string

if
                it is impossible to reformat the string.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "a0b1c2"

Output:

"0a1b2c"

Explanation:

No two adjacent characters have the same type in "0a1b2c". "a0b1c2", "0a1b2c", "0c2a1b" are also valid permutations.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "leetcode"

Output:

""

Explanation:

"leetcode" has only characters so we cannot separate them by digits.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "1229857369"

Output:

""

Explanation:

"1229857369" has only digits so we cannot separate them by characters.

Example 4:

Input:

s = "covid2019"

Output:

"c2o0v1i9d"

Example 5:

Input:

s = "ab123"

Output:

"1a2b3"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
