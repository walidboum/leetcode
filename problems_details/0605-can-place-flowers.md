## Description

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not.
        However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both
        would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1
        means not empty), and a number

n

, return if

n

new flowers can be planted in it
        without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Example 1:

Input:

flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1

Output:

True

Example 2:

Input:

flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2

Output:

False

Note:

The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.

The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].

n

is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
