## Description

Given the

root

of a binary tree and a node

u

in the tree,
            return

the

nearest

node on the

same level

that is
                to the

right

of

u

, or return

null

if

u

is the rightmost node in its level

.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,6], u = 4

Output:

5

Explanation:

The nearest node on the same level to the right of node 4 is node 5.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [3,null,4,2], u = 2

Output:

null

Explanation:

There are no nodes to the right of 2.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [1], u = 1

Output:

null

Example 4:

Input:

root = [3,4,2,null,null,null,1], u = 4

Output:

2

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range

[1, 10

5

]

.

1 <= Node.val <= 10

5

All values in the tree are

distinct

.

u

is a node in the binary tree rooted at

root

.
