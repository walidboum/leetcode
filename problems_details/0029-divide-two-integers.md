## Description

Given two integers

dividend

and

divisor

, divide two integers
        without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing

dividend

by

divisor

.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

Example 1:

Input:

dividend = 10, divisor = 3

Output:

3

Example 2:

Input:

dividend = 7, divisor = -3

Output:

-2

Note:

Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.

The divisor will never be 0.

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the
            32-bit signed integer range: [−2

31

,  2

31

− 1].
            For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 2

31

− 1 when the division result overflows.
