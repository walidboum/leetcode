## Description

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree.

Each camera atÂ a node can monitor

its parent, itself, and its immediate
        children

.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Example 1:

Input:

[0,0,null,0,0]

Output:

1

Explanation:

One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

Example 2:

Input:

[0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]

Output:

2

Explanation:

At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range

[1,
                    1000]

.

Every

node has value 0.
