## Description

We are given a list

nums

of integers representing a list compressed
            with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements

[a, b] = [nums[2*i],
                nums[2*i+1]]

(with

i >= 0

).  For each such pair,
                there are

a

elements with value

b

in the decompressed
                list.

Return the decompressed list.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output:

[2,4,4,4]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100

nums.length % 2 == 0

1 <= nums[i] <= 100
