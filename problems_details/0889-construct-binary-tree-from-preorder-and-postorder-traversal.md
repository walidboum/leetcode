## Description

Return any binary tree that matches the given preorder and postorder traversals.

Values in the traversals

pre

and

post

are distinctÂ positive
        integers.

Example 1:

Input:

pre =

[1,2,4,5,3,6,7]

, post =

[4,5,2,6,7,3,1]

Output:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Note:

1 <= pre.length == post.length <= 30

pre[]

and

post[]

are both permutations of

1, 2,
                ..., pre.length

.

It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there exists multiple answers, you can return
