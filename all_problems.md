## 0008-string-to-integer-atoi.md

# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/8.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/8.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Cisco, eBay, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Nvidia, Redfin, SAP, Tencent, Uber, Zillow

## Description

Implement

atoi

which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first
        non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional
        initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets
        them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which
        are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or
        if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace
        characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

Note:

Only the space character

' '

is considered as whitespace character.

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the
            32-bit signed integer range: [−2

31

,  2

31

−
            1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2

31

−
            1) or INT_MIN (−2

31

) is returned.

Example 1:

Input:

"42"

Output:

42

Example 2:

Input:

"   -42"

Output:

-42

Explanation:

The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

Example 3:

Input:

"4193 with words"

Output:

4193

Explanation:

Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

Example 4:

Input:

"words and 987"

Output:

0

Explanation:

The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

Example 5:

Input:

"-91283472332"

Output:

-2147483648

Explanation:

The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−2

31

) is returned.

## Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when
        it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input:

121

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

-121

Output:

false

Explanation:

From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input:

10

Output:

false

Explanation:

Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Companies:** Adobe, Airbnb, Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, ByteDance, Coursera, Cruise Automation, eBay, Facebook, Google, Houzz, Lyft, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir Technologies, Pocket Gems, Twitter, Uber, VMware, Zulily

## Description

Given an input string (

s

) and a pattern (

p

), implement regular
        expression matching with support for

'.'

and

'*'

.

'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the

entire

input string (not partial).

Note:

s

could be empty and contains only lowercase letters

a-z

.

p

could be empty and contains only lowercase letters

a-z

, and
            characters like

.

or

*

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aa"
p = "a"

Output:

false

Explanation:

"a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aa"
p = "a*"

Output:

true

Explanation:

'*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

Example 3:

Input:

s = "ab"
p = ".*"

Output:

true

Explanation:

".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

Example 4:

Input:

s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"

Output:

true

Explanation:

c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".

Example 5:

Input:

s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."

false

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/26.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/26.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Cisco, Cohesity, Facebook, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, Oracle, Uber

## Description

Given a sorted array

nums

, remove the duplicates

in-place

such that each element appear only

once

and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by

modifying the
        input array

in-place

with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given

nums

=

[1,1,2]

,

Your function should return length =

2

, with the first two elements of

nums

being

1

and

2

respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Given

nums

=

[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

,

Your function should return length =

5

, with the first five elements of

nums

being modified to

0

,

1

,

2

,

3

, and

4

respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by

reference

, which means
        modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

//

nums

is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to

nums

in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first

len

elements.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/36.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/36.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Cruise Automation, DoorDash, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Pinterest, Salesforce, Snapchat, Twitter, Uber

## Description

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be
        validated

according to the following rules

:

Each row must contain the digits

1-9

without repetition.

Each column must contain the digits

1-9

without repetition.

Each of the 9

3x3

sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits

1-9

without
            repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character

'.'

.

Example 1:

Input:

[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],

  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]

Output:

false

Explanation:

Same as Example 1, except with the

5

in the top left corner being
    modified to

8

. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.

Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

The given board contain only digits

1-9

and the character

## Description

Given an input string (

s

) and a pattern (

p

), implement wildcard
        pattern matching with support for

'?'

and

'*'

.

'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the

entire

input string (not partial).

Note:

s

could be empty and contains only lowercase letters

a-z

.

p

could be empty and contains only lowercase letters

a-z

, and
            characters like

?

or

*

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aa"
p = "a"

Output:

false

Explanation:

"a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aa"
p = "*"

Output:

true

Explanation:

'*' matches any sequence.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "cb"
p = "?a"

'?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.

Example 4:

Input:

s = "adceb"
p = "*a*b"

Output:

true

Explanation:

The first '*' matches the empty sequence, while the second '*' matches the substring "dce".

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Nutanix, Oracle, Postmates, Uber

## Description

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of
        the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Example 1:

Input:

[2,3,1,1,4]

Output:

true

Explanation:

Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Example 2:

Input:

[3,2,1,0,4]

Output:

false

Explanation:

You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

# 68. Text Justification

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/68.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/68.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Box, Coursera, Facebook, Google, Indeed, Intuit, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft, Pinterest, Robinhood, Snapchat, Twilio, Twitter, Uber

## Description

Given an array of words and a width

maxWidth

, format the text such that each
        line has exactly

maxWidth

characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in
        each line. Pad extra spaces

' '

when necessary so that each line has
        exactly

maxWidth

characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of
        spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be
        assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no

extra

space is
        inserted between words.

Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters
            only.

Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed

maxWidth

.

The input array

words

contains at least one word.

Example 1:

Input:

words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16

Output:

[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]

Example 2:

Input:

words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
maxWidth = 16

Output:

[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]

Explanation:

Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
             because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
             Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.

Example 3:

Input:

words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
         "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
maxWidth = 20

Output:

[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "

# 71. Simplify Path

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/71.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/71.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, ByteDance, Docusign, Facebook, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Yandex

## Description

Given an

absolute path

for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other
        words, convert it to the

canonical path

.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period

.

refers to the current directory.
        Furthermore, a double period

..

moves the directory up a level. For more
        information, see:

Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash

/

, and
        there must be only a single slash

/

between two directory names. The
        last directory name (if it exists)

must not

end with a trailing

/

.
        Also, the canonical path must be the

shortest

string representing the
        absolute path.

Example 1:

Input: "

/home/"

Output: "

/home"

Explanation:

Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

Example 2:

Input: "

/../"

Output: "

/"

Explanation:

Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

Example 3:

Input: "

/home//foo/"

Output: "

/home/foo"

Explanation:

In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/73.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/73.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Docusign, Expedia, Facebook, Microsoft, Oracle, Paypal, Salesforce, TripAdvisor

## Description

Given a

m

x

n

matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to
        0. Do it

in-place

.

Example 1:

Input:

[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]

Output:

[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]

Example 2:

Input:

[
  [0,1,2,0],
  [3,4,5,2],
  [1,3,1,5]
]

Output:

[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [0,4,5,0],
  [0,3,1,0]
]

Follow up:

A straight forward solution using O(

m

n

) space is probably a bad idea.

A simple improvement uses O(

m

+

n

) space, but still not the best
            solution.

Could you devise a constant space solution?

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, eBay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Paypal, Pocket Gems, Pure Storage, Uber, Walmart Labs, Yahoo

## Description

Given an array with

n

objects colored red, white or blue, sort them

in-place

so
        that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and
        blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue
        respectively.

Note:

You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for
        this problem.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output:
[0,0,1,1,2,2]
Follow up:
A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then
            overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/80.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/80.html)

**Companies:** Baidu, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google

## Description

Given a sorted array

nums

, remove the duplicates

in-place

such that duplicates appeared at most

twice

and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by

modifying the
        input array

in-place

with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given

nums

=

[1,1,1,2,2,3]

,

Your function should return length =

5

, with the first five elements of

nums

being

1, 1, 2, 2

and

3

respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Given

nums

=

[0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]

,

Your function should return length =

7

, with the first seven elements of

nums

being modified to

0

,

0

,

1

,

1

,

2

,

3

and

3

respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by

reference

, which means
        modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

//

nums

is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to

nums

in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first

len

elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return

true

,
        otherwise return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2

,5,6,0,0,1,2]

, target = 0

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2

# 87. Scramble String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/87.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/87.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a string

s1

, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two
        non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of

s1

=

"great"

:

great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t

To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node

"gr"

and swap its two children, it
        produces a scrambled string

"rgeat"

.

rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t

We say that

"rgeat"

is a scrambled string of

"great"

.

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes

"eat"

and

"at"

, it produces a scrambled string

"rgtae"

.

rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a

We say that

"rgtae"

is a scrambled string of

"great"

.

Given two strings

s1

and

s2

of the same length, determine if

s2

is
        a scrambled string of

s1

.

Example 1:

Input:

s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"

# 89. Gray Code

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/89.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/89.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one
        bit.

Given a non-negative integer

n

representing the total number of bits in the code,
        print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

Example 1:

Input:

2

Output:

[0,1,3,2]

Explanation:

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given

n

, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1

Example 2:

Input:

0

Output:

[0]

Explanation:

We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of

n

has size = 2

n

, which for

n

= 0 the size is 2

0

= 1.
             Therefore, for

n

= 0 the gray code sequence is [0].

# 115. Distinct Subsequences

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/115.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/115.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Barclays, Google

## Description

Given a string

S

and a string

T

, count the number of
        distinct subsequences of

S

which equals

T

.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by
        deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of
        the remaining characters. (ie,

"ACE"

is a subsequence of

"ABCDE"

while

"AEC"

is not).

Example 1:

Input:

S =

"rabbbit"

, T =

"rabbit"

Output:

3

Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit

^^^^ ^^

rabbbit

^^ ^^^^

rabbbit

^^^ ^^^

Example 2:

Input:

S =

"babgbag"

## 0116-populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node.md

# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/116.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/116.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Nutanix, Oracle, VMware

## Description

You are given a

perfect binary tree

where all leaves are on the
        same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node,
        the next pointer should be set to

NULL

.

Initially, all next pointers are set to

NULL

.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
{"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}
Output:
{"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}
Explanation:
Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
Note:
You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this
            problem.

## Description

Say you have an array for which the

i

th

element is the price of a given
        stock on day

i

.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one
        share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input:

[7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output:

5

Explanation:

Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

Example 2:

Input:

[7,6,4,3,1]

Output:

0

Explanation:

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/122.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/122.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Citadel, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Uber, Yahoo

## Description

Say you have an array for which the

i

th

element is the price of a given
        stock on day

i

.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you
        like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e.,
        you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input:

[7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output:

7

Explanation:

Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,2,3,4,5]

Output:

4

Explanation:

Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

Example:
Input:
[1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output:
25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path
1->2
represents the number
12

Input:
[4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output:
1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path
4->9->5
represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path
4->9->1
represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path
4->0
represents the number 40.

# 130. Surrounded Regions

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/130.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/130.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Splunk, Uber

## Description

Given a 2D board containing

'X'

and

'O'

(

the
        letter O

), capture all regions surrounded by

'X'

.

A region is captured by flipping all

'O'

s into

'X'

s
        in that surrounded region.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
Explanation:
Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any
'O'
on the border of the board are not flipped to
'X'
.
        Any
'O'
that is not on the border and it is not connected to an
'O'
on the border will be flipped to
'X'
. Two
        cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Note:
The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
The undirected graph is a
simple graph
, which means no repeated edges and no
            self-loops in the graph.
Since the graph is undirected, if node
p
has node
q
as neighbor,
            then node
q
must have node
p
as neighbor too.
You must return the
copy of the given node
as a reference to the cloned
            graph.

## 0134-gas-station.md

# 134. Gas Station

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/134.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/134.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Expedia, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Paypal

## Description

There are

N

gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station

i

is

gas[i]

.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs

cost[i]

of gas to travel
        from station

i

to its next station (

i

+1). You begin the journey with an
        empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the
        clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

Note:

If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.

Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

Example 1:

Input:

gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output:

3

Explanation:

Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

Example 2:

Input:

gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

# 147. Insertion Sort List

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/147.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/147.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg, Microsoft

## Description

Sort a linked list using insertion sort.

A graphical example of insertion sort. The partial sorted list (black) initially
            contains only the first element in the list.

With each iteration one element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted
            in-place into the sorted list

Algorithm of Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a
            sorted output list.

At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the
            location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.

It repeats until no input elements remain.

Example 1:

Input:

4->2->1->3

Output:

1->2->3->4

Example 2:

Input:

-1->5->3->4->0

# 156. Binary Tree Upside Down

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/156.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/156.html)

**Companies:** LinkedIn

## Description

Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left
        node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree
        where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[1,2,3,4,5]

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
Output:
return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1]

    / \
   3   1
Clarification:
Confused what
[4,5,2,#,#,3,1
]
means? Read
        more below on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#'
        signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
Here's an example:
1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
The above binary tree is serialized as

# 157. Read N Characters Given Read4

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/157.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/157.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, Google

## Description

Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given
        method

read4

, implement a method to read

n

characters.

Method read4:

The API

read4

reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes
        those characters into the buffer array

buf

.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that

read4()

has its own file pointer, much like

FILE *fp

in C.

Definition of read4:

Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]

Below is a high level example of how

read4

works:

File file("abcdefghijk"); // File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "efgh", fp points to 'i'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = "ijk", fp points to end of file

Method read:

By using the

read4

method, implement the method

read

that
        reads

n

characters from the file and store it in the buffer
        array

buf

. Consider that you

cannot

manipulate the file
        directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Definition of read:

Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]

Example 1:

Input:

file = "abc", n = 4

Output:

3

Explanation:

After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3. Note that "abc" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

Example 2:

Input:

file = "abcde", n = 5

Output:

5

Explanation:

After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcde". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

Example 3:

Input:

file = "abcdABCD1234", n = 12

Output:

12

Explanation:

After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcdABCD1234". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

Example 4:

Input:

file = "leetcode", n = 5

Output:

5

Explanation:

After calling your read method, buf should contain "leetc". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

Note:

Consider that you

cannot

manipulate the file directly, the file is only
            accesible for

read4

but

not

for

read

.

The

read

function will only be called once for each test case.

You may assume the destination buffer array,

buf

, is guaranteed
            to have enough space for storing

n

characters.

        method

read4

, implement a method

read

to read

n

characters.

Your method

read

may be called multiple times.

Method read4:

The API

sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.

Example 2:

File file("abc");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.

## 0160-intersection-of-two-linked-lists.md

# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/160.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/160.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Alibaba, Amazon, Bloomberg, ByteDance, Cisco, Expedia, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Redfin, SAP, Tencent, Uber, Yahoo

## Description

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists
        begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

Example 1:

Input:

intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3

Output:

Reference of the node with value = 8

Input Explanation:

The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

Example 2:

Input:

intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1

Output:

Reference of the node with value = 2

Input Explanation:

The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Example 3:

Input:

intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2

Output:

null

Input Explanation:

From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

Explanation:

The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return

null

.

The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

## 0165-compare-version-numbers.md

# 165. Compare Version Numbers

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/165.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/165.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Arista Networks, Google, Microsoft, Square

## Description

Compare two version numbers

version1

and

version2

.

If

version1

>

version2

return

1;

if

version1

<

version2

return

-1;

otherwise
        return

0

.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the

.

character.

The

.

character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate
        number sequences.

For instance,

2.5

is not "two and a half" or "half way to version
        three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be

0

. For example, version number

3.4

has a revision number of

3

and

4

for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth
        level revision number are both

0

.

Example 1:

Input:

version1

= "0.1",

version2

= "1.1"

Output:

-1

Example 2:

Input:

version1

= "1.0.1",

version2

= "1"

Output:

1

Example 3:

Input:

version1

= "7.5.2.4",

version2

= "7.5.3"

Output:

-1

Example 4:

Input:

version1

= "1.01",

version2

= "1.001"

Output:

0

Explanation:

Ignoring leading zeroes, both â01â and â001" represent the same number â1â

Example 5:

Input:

version1

= "1.0",

version2

= "1.0.0"

**Companies:** Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Cisco, eBay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Qualtrics, Splunk, Uber

## Description

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with
        the root node of a BST.

Calling

next()

will return the next smallest number in the BST.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
BSTIterator iterator = new BSTIterator(root);
iterator.next();    // return 3
iterator.next();    // return 7
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 9
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 15
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 20
iterator.hasNext(); // return false
Note:
next()
and
hasNext()
should run in average O(1) time and uses
            O(
h
) memory, where
h
is the height of the tree.
You may assume that
next()
call will always be valid, that
            is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when
next()
is
            called.

# 174. Dungeon Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/174.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/174.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft

## Description

The demons had captured the princess (

P

) and imprisoned her in the
        bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid.
        Our valiant knight (

K

) was initially positioned in the top-left room and
        must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his
        health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (

negative

integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (

0's

) or
        contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (

positive

integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only
        rightward or downward in each step.

Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is
        able to rescue the princess.

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least

7

if he follows the optimal path

RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN ->
            DOWN

.

-2 (K)

-3

3

-5

-10

1

10

30

-5 (P)

Note:

The knight's health has no upper bound.

Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the
            bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the
        department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of
        rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, Tencent

## Description

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Example 1:

Input:

00000010100101000001111010011100

Output:

00111001011110000010100101000000

Explanation:

The input binary string

00000010100101000001111010011100

represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is

00111001011110000010100101000000

.

Example 2:

Input:

11111111111111111111111111111101

Output:

10111111111111111111111111111111

Explanation:

The input binary string

11111111111111111111111111111101

represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is

10101111110010110010011101101001

.

Note:

Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this
            case, both input and output will be given as signed integer type and should not affect
            your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same
            whether it is signed or unsigned.

In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using

2's
            complement notation

. Therefore, in

Example 2

above the input
            represents the signed integer

-3

and the output represents the signed
            integer

-1073741825

.

## Description

Given two strings

s

and

t

, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in

s

can be replaced to get

t

.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the
        order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map
        to itself.

Example 1:

Input:

s

=

"egg",

t =

"add"

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

s

=

"foo",

t =

"bar"

## Description

There are a total of

n

courses you have to take, labeled from

0

to

n-1

.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take
        course 1, which is expressed as a pair:

[0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite

pairs

, return
        the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

        impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:

Input:

2, [[1,0]]

Output:

[0,1]

Explanation:

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished
             course 0. So the correct course order is

[0,1] .

Example 2:

Input:

4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]

Output:

[0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]

Explanation:

There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
             So one correct course order is

[0,1,2,3]

. Another correct ordering is

[0,2,1,3] .

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/218.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/218.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Databricks, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, Houzz, Microsoft, Salesforce, Tableau, Twitter, Uber, Yelp

## Description

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in
        that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are

given the locations and height
            of all the buildings

as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to

output the skyline

formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).

The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers

[Li,
        Ri, Hi]

, where

Li

and

Ri

are the x coordinates of the left
        and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and

Hi

is its height. It is
        guaranteed that

0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX

,

0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX

,
        and

Ri - Li > 0

. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles
        grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as:

[ [2 9 10],
        [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ]

.

The output is a list of "

key points

" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of

[ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ]

that uniquely defines a skyline.

A key
            point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment

. Note that the last key
        point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the
        skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings
        should be considered part of the skyline contour.

For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:

[ [2 10], [3 15], [7
        12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ]

.

Notes:

The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range

[0,
            10000]

.

The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position

Li

.

The output list must be sorted by the x position.

There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For
            instance,

[...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...]

is not acceptable;
            the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such:

[...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]

## 0225-implement-stack-using-queues.md

# 225. Implement Stack using Queues

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/225.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/225.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Citadel, Mathworks, Microsoft, Twilio, Yahoo

## Description

Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.

pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.

top() -- Get the top element.

empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
MyStack stack = new MyStack();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.top();   // returns 2
stack.pop();   // returns 2
stack.empty(); // returns false
Notes:
You must use
only
standard operations of a queue -- which means only
push
            to back
,
peek/pop from front
,
size
, and
is
            empty
operations are valid.
Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a
            queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard
            operations of a queue.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will
            be called on an empty stack).

## 0251-flatten-2d-vector.md

# 251. Flatten 2D Vector

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/251.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/251.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Lyft, Salesforce, Twitter, Uber, Zenefits

## Description

Design and implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector. It should support the following
        operations:

next

and

hasNext

.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Vector2D iterator = new Vector2D([[1,2],[3],[4]]);

iterator.next(); // return 1
iterator.next(); // return 2
iterator.next(); // return 3
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next(); // return 4
iterator.hasNext(); // return false
Notes:
Please remember to
RESET
your class variables declared in Vector2D, as
            static/class variables are
persisted across multiple test cases
. Please see
here
for more details.
You may assume that
next()
call will always be valid, that is, there will
            be at least a next element in the 2d vector when
next()
is called.
Follow up:
As an added challenge, try to code it using only
iterators
        in C++
or
iterators in Java
.

## Description

There are a row of

n

houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors:
        red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You
        have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a

n

x

3

cost matrix. For example,

costs[0][0]

is the cost of painting house 0 with
        color red;

costs[1][2]

is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so
        on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Companies:** Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Uber

## Description

There are a row of

n

houses, each house can be painted with one of the

k

colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint
        all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a

n

x

k

cost matrix. For example,

costs[0][0]

is the cost of painting house 0 with
        color 0;

costs[1][2]

is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on...
        Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

## Description

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters
        are unknown to you. You receive a list of

non-empty

words from the dictionary, where

words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language

. Derive the
        order of letters in this language.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/270.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/270.html)

# 271. Encode and Decode Strings

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/271.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/271.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg, Google, Microsoft, Square, Twitter

## Description

Design an algorithm to encode

a list of strings

to

a string

. The encoded string
        is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector<string> strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector<string> decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded_string = encode(strs);

and Machine 2 does:

vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);

strs2

in Machine 2 should be the same as

strs

in Machine 1.

Implement the

encode

and

decode

methods.

Note:

The string may contain any possible characters out of 256 valid ascii characters. Your
            algorithm should be generalized enough to work on any possible characters.

Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode
            algorithms should be stateless.

Do not rely on any library method such as

eval

or serialize methods. You
            should implement your own encode/decode algorithm.

## 0277-find-the-celebrity.md

# 277. Find the Celebrity

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/277.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/277.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Pinterest, Square, Uber

## Description

Suppose you are at a party with

n

people (labeled from

0

to

n
        - 1

) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is
        that all the other

n - 1

people know him/her but he/she does not know any of
        them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing
        you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get
        information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not
        one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function

bool knows(a, b)

which tells you whether A knows
        B. Implement a function

int findCelebrity(n)

. There will be exactly one
        celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a
        celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

graph =

[
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,1,1]
]

Output:

1

Explanation:

There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

Example 2:

Input:

graph =

[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,1]
]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

There is no celebrity.

Note:

The directed graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is an

n x
            n

matrix where

a[i][j] = 1

means person

i

knows
            person

j

while

a[i][j] = 0

means the contrary.

Remember that you won't have direct access to the adjacency matrix.

# 278. First Bad Version

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/278.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/278.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber

## Description

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
        Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each
        version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are
        also bad.

Suppose you have

n

versions

[1, 2, ..., n]

and you want to find out
        the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API

bool isBadVersion(version)

which will return whether

version

is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number
        of calls to the API.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.

## Description

Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
v1 = [1,2]
v2 = [3,4,5,6]
Output:
[1,3,2,4,5,6]
Explanation:
By calling
next
repeatedly until
hasNext
returns
false
,
             the order of elements returned by
next
should be:
[1,3,2,4,5,6]
.
Follow up
: What if you are given

1d vectors? How well can your code be
        extended to such cases?
Clarification
for the follow up question
:
The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for
k >
            2
cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag"
        with "Cyclic". For example:

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/284.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/284.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Paypal, Walmart Labs, Yahoo

## Description

Given an Iterator class interface with methods:

next()

and

hasNext()

, design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the

peek()

operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned
        by the next call to next().

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list:
[1,2,3]
.

Call
next()
gets you
1
, the first element in the list.
Now you call
peek()
and it returns
2
, the next element. Calling
next()
after that
still
return
2
.
You call
next()
the final time and it returns
3
, the last element.
Calling
hasNext()
after that should return
false
.

## Description

Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the
        BST.

The successor of a node

p

is the node with the smallest key greater
        than

p.val

.

Example 1:

Input:

root =

[2,1,3]

, p =

1

Output:

2

Explanation:

1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

Example 2:

Input:

root =

[5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1]

, p =

6

Output:

null

Explanation:

There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is

null

.

Note:

If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return

null

.

It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/286.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/286.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, ByteDance, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber

## Description

You are given a

m x n

2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1

- A wall or an obstacle.

0

- A gate.

INF

- Infinity means an empty room. We use the value

2

31

-
            1 = 2147483647

to represent

INF

as you may assume that the distance
            to a gate is less than

2147483647

.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its

nearest

gate. If it is impossible to
        reach a gate, it should be filled with

INF

.

### Example

```
Example:
Given the 2D grid:
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

## 0288-unique-word-abbreviation.md

# 288. Unique Word Abbreviation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/288.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/288.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

## 0289-game-of-life.md

# 289. Game of Life

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/289.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/289.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Booking.com, Dropbox, Evernote, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, Opendoor, Oracle, Reddit, Snapchat, Two Sigma, Uber, Zillow

## Description

According to the

Wikipedia's article

: "The

Game of
        Life

, also known simply as

Life

, is a cellular automaton devised by the British
        mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a

board

with

m

by

n

cells, each cell has an initial state

live

(1) or

dead

(0). Each cell interacts with its

eight
            neighbors

(horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken
        from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
            under-population.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
            reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current
        state.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
Follow up
:
Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same
            time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update
            other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is
            infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the
            array. How would you address these problems?

**Companies:** Adobe

## Description

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the
        table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last
        stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Atlassian, Bloomberg, ByteDance, eBay, Expedia, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, Pinterest, Qualtrics, Snapchat, Twitter, Uber, VMware, Yahoo

## Description

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there
        is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,

[2,3,4]

, the median is

3

[2,3]

, the median is

(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data
            structure.

double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3)
findMedian() -> 2
Follow up:
If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you
            optimize it?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Citadel, eBay, Expedia, Facebook, Google, Groupon, Indeed, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Qualtrics, Quora, Salesforce, Tableau, Uber, VMware, Yahoo

## Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
        so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network
        connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on
        how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a
        binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the
        original tree structure.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as
"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification:
The above format is the same as
how LeetCode serializes a binary tree
.
        You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with
        different approaches yourself.
Note:
Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states.
        Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
```

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Google, Zillow

## Description

You are playing the following

Bulls and Cows

game with your friend:
        You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your
        friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match
        your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how
        many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows").
        Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use

A

to indicate the bulls and

B

to indicate the cows.

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

Example 1:

Input:

secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

Output:

"1A3B"

Explanation:

1

bull and

3

cows. The bull is

8

, the cows are

0

,

1

and

7

.

Example 2:

Input:

secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

Output:

"1A1B"

Explanation:

The 1st

1

in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd

1

is a cow

.

Note:

You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only
        contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, Uber

## Description

A 2d grid map of

m

rows and

n

columns is initially filled with
        water. We may perform an

addLand

operation which turns the water at position (row,
        col) into a land. Given a list of positions to operate,

count the number of islands after
            each

addLand

operation

. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by
        connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the
        grid are all surrounded by water.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]

## 0306-additive-number.md

# 306. Additive Number

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/306.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/306.html)

**Companies:** Epic Systems

## Description

Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain

at least

three numbers. Except for the first
        two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits

'0'-'9'

, write a function
        to determine if it's an additive number.

Note:

Numbers in the additive sequence

cannot

have leading zeros, so sequence

1, 2, 03

or

1, 02, 3

is invalid.

Example 1:

Input:

"112358"

Output:

true

Explanation:

The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
             1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

Example 2:

Input:

"199100199"

Output:

true

Explanation:

The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
             1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

Constraints:

num

consists only of digits

'0'-'9'

.

1 <= num.length <= 35

Follow up:

How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?

## 0310-minimum-height-trees.md

# 310. Minimum Height Trees

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/310.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/310.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snapchat

## Description

For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The
        result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum
        height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find
        all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

Format

The graph contains

n

nodes which are labeled from

0

to

n -
            1

. You will be given the number

n

and a list of undirected

edges

(each edge is a pair of labels).

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in

edges

. Since all edges are
        undirected,

[0, 1]

is the same as

[1, 0]

and thus will not appear
        together in

edges

.

Example 1 :

Input:

n = 4

,

edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3

Output:

[1]

Example 2 :

Input:

n = 6

,

edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

0  1  2
      \ | /
        3
        |
        4
        |
        5

Output:

[3, 4]

Note

:

According to the

definition of tree on Wikipedia

: “a tree
            is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by

exactly

one
            path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”

The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between
            the root and a leaf.

## Description

Given

n

nodes labeled from

0

to

n - 1

and a list of
        undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of
        connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5

and

edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

0          3
     |          |

Note:

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in

edges

. Since all edges
        are undirected,

[0, 1]

is the same as

# 330. Patching Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/330.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/330.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a sorted positive integer array

nums

and an integer

n

, add/patch elements
        to the array such that any number in range

[1, n]

inclusive can be formed by
        the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

Example 1:

Input:

nums

=

[1,3]

,

n

=

6

Output:

1

Explanation:

Combinations of

nums

are

[1], [3], [1,3]

, which form possible sums of:

1, 3, 4

.
Now if we add/patch

2

to

nums

, the combinations are:

[1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]

.
Possible sums are

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

, which now covers the range

[1, 6]

.
So we only need

1

patch.

Example 2:

Input:

nums

=

[1,5,10]

,

n

=

20

Output:

2

Explanation:

The two patches can be

## 0331-verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree.md

# 331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/331.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/331.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a
        non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a
        sentinel value such as

#

.

_9_
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6
/ \ / \   / \
# # # #   # #

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string

"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"

,
        where

#

represents a null node.

Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal
        serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character

'#'

representing

null

pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two
        consecutive commas such as

"1,,3"

.

Example 1:

Input:

"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

"1,#"

Output:

false

## Description

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports

[from,
        to]

, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who
        departs from

JFK

. Thus, the itinerary must begin with

JFK

.

Note:

If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the
            smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary

["JFK",
                "LGA"]

has a smaller lexical order than

["JFK",
                "LGB"]

.

All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

Example 1:

Input:

[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]

Output:

["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]

Example 2:

Input:

[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]

Output:

["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]

Explanation:

Another possible reconstruction is

["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]

[0,1,1]

Example 2:

Input:

5

Output:

[0,1,1,2,1,2]

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time

O(n*sizeof(integer))

.
            But can you do it in linear time

O(n)

/possibly in a single pass?

Space complexity should be

O(n)

.

Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like

__builtin_popcount

in c++ or in any other language.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/348.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/348.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, DoorDash, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TripleByte, Uber

## Description

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a

n

x

n

grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.

Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.

A player who succeeds in placing

n

of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or
            diagonal row wins the game.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Given
n
= 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

## 0351-android-unlock-patterns.md

# 351. Android Unlock Patterns

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/351.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/351.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Google

## Description

Given an Android

3x3

key lock screen and two integers

m

and

n

, where 1
        ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 9, count the total number of unlock patterns of the Android lock screen,
        which consist of minimum of

m

keys and maximum

n

keys.

Rules for a valid pattern:

Each pattern must connect at least

m

keys and at most

n

keys.

All the keys must be distinct.

If the line connecting two consecutive keys in the pattern passes through any other
            keys, the other keys must have previously selected in the pattern. No jumps through non
            selected key is allowed.

The order of keys used matters.

Explanation:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

Invalid move:

4 - 1 - 3 - 6

Line 1 - 3 passes through key 2 which had not been selected in the pattern.

Invalid move:

4 - 1 - 9 - 2

Line 1 - 9 passes through key 5 which had not been selected in the pattern.

Valid move:

2 - 4 - 1 - 3 - 6

Line 1 - 3 is valid because it passes through key 2, which had been selected in the pattern

Valid move:

6 - 5 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 2

Line 1 - 9 is valid because it passes through key 5, which had been selected in the pattern.

## Examples

```
Example:
Input:
m =
1
, n =
1
Output:
9

## 0353-design-snake-game.md

# 353. Design Snake Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/353.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/353.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Salesforce, Uber, Zillow

## Description

Design a

Snake
        game

that is played on a device with screen size =

width

x

height

.

Play the game online

if you
        are not familiar with the game.

The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner (0,0) with length = 1 unit.

You are given a list of food's positions in row-column order. When a snake eats the food,
        its length and the game's score both increase by 1.

Each food appears one by one on the screen. For example, the second food will not appear
        until the first food was eaten by the snake.

When a food does appear on the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block
        occupied by the snake.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Given width = 3, height = 2, and food = [[1,2],[0,1]].

Snake snake = new Snake(width, height, food);

Initially the snake appears at position (0,0) and the food at (1,2).

|S| | |
| | |F|

snake.move("R"); -> Returns 0

| |S| |
| | |F|

snake.move("D"); -> Returns 0

| | | |
| |S|F|

snake.move("R"); -> Returns 1 (Snake eats the first food and right after that, the second food appears at (0,1) )

| |F| |
| |S|S|

snake.move("U"); -> Returns 1

| |F|S|
| | |S|

snake.move("L"); -> Returns 2 (Snake eats the second food)

| |S|S|
| | |S|

snake.move("U"); -> Returns -1 (Game over because snake collides with border)

// User 1 follows user 2.
twitter.follow(1, 2);

// User 2 posts a new tweet (id = 6).
twitter.postTweet(2, 6);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 2 tweet ids -> [6, 5].
// Tweet id 6 should precede tweet id 5 because it is posted after tweet id 5.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);

// User 1 unfollows user 2.
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5],

# 359. Logger Rate Limiter

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/359.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/359.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Uber

## Description

Design a logger system that receive stream of messages along with its timestamps, each
        message should be printed if and only if it is

not printed in the last 10 seconds

.

Given a message and a timestamp (in seconds granularity), return true if the message should
        be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.

It is possible that several messages arrive roughly at the same time.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Logger logger = new Logger();

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 1
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo"); returns true;

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 2
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2,"bar"); returns true;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 3
logger.shouldPrintMessage(3,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 8
logger.shouldPrintMessage(8,"bar"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 10
logger.shouldPrintMessage(10,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(11,"foo"); returns true;

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/361.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/361.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Uber

## Description

Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall

'W'

, an enemy

'E'

or empty

'0'

(the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill
        using one bomb.

The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it
        hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.

Note:

You can only put the bomb at an empty cell.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[["0","E","0","0"],["E","0","W","E"],["0","E","0","0"]]

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/362.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/362.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Booking.com, Dropbox, Google, Indeed, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Pinterest, Quip (Salesforce), Snapchat, Uber, Visa, Yahoo, Zillow

## Description

Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.

Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that
        calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is
        monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.

It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.
counter.hit(1);

// hit at timestamp 2.
counter.hit(2);

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
counter.getHits(4);

// hit at timestamp 300.
counter.hit(300);

// get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
counter.getHits(300);

// get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
counter.getHits(301);
Follow up:
What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?

Output:
2
Explanation:
Because the sum of rectangle
[[0, 1], [-2, 3]]
is 2,
             and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
Note:
The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?

**Companies:** DiDi, Facebook, LinkedIn

## Description

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their
        depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other
        lists.

Different from the

previous
        question

where weight is increasing from root to leaf, now the weight is defined from
        bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the
        largest weight.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,1],2,[1,1]]

Output:

8

Explanation:

F

our 1's at depth 1, one 2 at depth 2.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,[4,[6]]]

Output:

17

Explanation:

O

ne 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1; 1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17.

## 0376-wiggle-subsequence.md

# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/376.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/376.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Uber

## Description

A sequence of numbers is called a

wiggle sequence

if the differences between
        successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference
        (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements
        is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example,

[1,7,4,9,2,5]

is a wiggle sequence because the differences

(6,-3,5,-7,3)

are alternately positive and negative. In contrast,

[1,4,7,2,5]

and

[1,7,4,5,5]

are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the
        second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle
        sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also
        zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original
        order.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,7,4,9,2,5]

Output:

6

Explanation:

The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]

Output:

7

Explanation:

There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

Example 3:

Input:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

2

## 0388-longest-absolute-file-path.md

# 388. Longest Absolute File Path

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/388.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/388.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Uber, Wish

## Description

Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string

"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"

represents:

dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext

The directory

dir

contains an empty sub-directory

subdir1

and a
        sub-directory

subdir2

containing a file

file.ext

.

The string

"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"

represents:

dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext

The directory

dir

contains two sub-directories

subdir1

and

subdir2

.

subdir1

contains a file

file1.ext

and an empty second-level
        sub-directory

subsubdir1

.

subdir2

contains a second-level
        sub-directory

subsubdir2

containing a file

file2.ext

.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file
        within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path
        is

"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"

, and its length is

32

(not
        including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the
        longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the
        system, return

0

.

Note:

The name of a file contains at least a

.

and an extension.

The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a

.

.

Time complexity required:

O(n)

where

n

is the size of the input
        string.

Notice that

a/aa/aaa/file1.txt

is not the longest file path, if there is another
        path

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png

.

## 0392-is-subsequence.md

# 392. Is Subsequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/392.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/392.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Pinterest

## Description

Given a string

s

and a string

t

, check if

s

is subsequence of

t

.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both

s

and

t

.

t

is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and

s

is a short
        string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by
        deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of
        the remaining characters. (ie,

"ace"

is a subsequence of

"abcde"

while

"aec"

is not).

Example 1:

s

=

"abc"

,

t

=

"ahbgdc"

Return

true

.

Example 2:

s

=

"axc"

,

t

=

"ahbgdc"

Return

false

.

Follow up:

If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check
        one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your
        code?

## 0393-utf-8-validation.md

# 393. UTF-8 Validation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/393.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/393.html)

**Companies:** Apple, Facebook, Google, Palantir Technologies

## Description

A character in UTF8 can be from

1 to 4 bytes

long, subjected to the following rules:

For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.

For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1
            bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8
        encoding.

Note:

The input is an array of integers. Only the

least significant 8 bits

of each integer
        is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

Example 1:

data = [197, 130, 1], which represents the octet sequence:

11000101 10000010 00000001

.

Return

true

.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.

Example 2:

data = [235, 140, 4], which represented the octet sequence:

11101011 10001100 00000100

.

Return

false

.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

to be its length.

Assume

B

k

to be an array obtained by rotating the array

A

k

positions clock-wise, we define a "rotation function"

on

A

as follow:

F(k) = 0 * B

k

[0] + 1 * B

k

[1] + ... + (n-1) * B

k

[n-1]

.

Calculate the maximum value of

F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1)

.

Note:

n

is guaranteed to be less than 10

5

.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
A = [4, 3, 2, 6]

F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26

So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.

.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Given
a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
queries are:
a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
return
[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
The input is:
vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>&
        values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries
, where
equations.size()
        == values.size()
, and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return
vector<double>

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/403.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/403.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Nutanix, Oracle, Snapchat

## Description

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or
        may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the
        water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog
        is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first
        stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was

k

units, then its next jump must be either

k

- 1,

k

, or

k

+ 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.

Note:

The number of stones is ≥ 2 and is < 1,100.

Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 2

31

.

The first stone's position is always 0.

Example 1:

[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

There are a total of 8 stones.
The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
The last stone at the 17th unit.

Return true

. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping
1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then
2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

Example 2:

[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]

Return false

. There is no way to jump to the last stone as
the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

# 413. Arithmetic Slices

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/413.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/413.html)

**Companies:** Aetion, Baidu, Bloomberg, Facebook

## Description

A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if
        the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequence:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9

The following sequence is not arithmetic.

1, 1, 2, 5, 7

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of
        integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:

A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.

# 419. Battleships in a Board

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/419.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/419.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft

## Description

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with

'X'

s, empty slots are represented with

'.'

s. You may assume the
    following rules:

You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.

Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only
            be made of the shape

1xN

(1 row, N columns) or

Nx1

(N rows, 1
            column), where N can be of any size.

At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are
            no adjacent battleships.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
X..X
...X
...X
In the above board there are 2 battleships.
Invalid Example:
...X
XXXX
...X
This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell
    separating between them.
Follow up:
Could you do it in
one-pass
, using only
O(1) extra memory
and
without modifying
the value of the board?

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/426.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/426.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Databricks, Facebook, Google, Lyft, Microsoft, Oracle

## Description

Convert a BST to a sorted circular doubly-linked list in-place. Think of the left and right
        pointers as synonymous to the previous and next pointers in a doubly-linked list.

Let's take the following BST as an example, it may help you understand the problem
        better:

We want to transform this BST into a circular doubly linked list. Each node in a doubly
        linked list has a predecessor and successor. For a circular doubly linked list, the
        predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element
        is the first element.

The figure below shows the circular doubly linked list for the BST above. The "head"
        symbol means the node it points to is the smallest element of the linked list.

Specifically, we want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left
        pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point
        to its successor. We should return the pointer to the first element of the linked list.

The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates the successor
        relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor relationship.

**Companies:** Apple, Google, Microsoft, Uber

## Description

We want to use quad trees to store an

N x N

boolean grid. Each cell in the grid
        can only be true or false. The root node represents the whole grid. For each node, it will
        be subdivided into four children nodes

until the values in the region it represents
            are all the same

.

Each node has another two boolean attributes :

isLeaf

and

val

.

isLeaf

is true if and only if the node is a leaf node. The

val

attribute for a leaf node contains the value of the region it represents.

Your task is to use a quad tree to represent a given grid. The following example may help you
        understand the problem better:

Given the

8 x 8

grid below, we want to construct the corresponding quad tree:

It can be divided according to the definition above:

The corresponding quad tree should be as following, where each node is represented as a

(isLeaf, val)

pair.

For the non-leaf nodes,

val

can be arbitrary, so it is represented as

*

.

Note:

N

is less than

1000

and guaranteened to be a power of 2.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/428.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/428.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Pinterest, Uber

## Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
        so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network
        connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted
        tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your
        serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary
        tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree
        structure.

For example, you may serialize the following

3-ary

tree

as

[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]

. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so
        please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note:

N

is in the range of

[1, 1000]

Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and
            deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

## Description

Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to
        get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more
        than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more
        than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work.
        You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary
        tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.

## 0433-minimum-genetic-mutation.md

# 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/433.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/433.html)

**Companies:** Google, Twitter

## Description

A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from

"A"

,

"C"

,

"G"

,

"T"

.

Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation (mutation from "start" to "end"),
        where ONE mutation is defined as ONE single character changed in the gene string.

For example,

"AACCGGTT"

->

"AACCGGTA"

is 1
        mutation.

Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. A
        gene must be in the bank to make it a valid gene string.

Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the minimum number
        of mutations needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there is no such
        a mutation, return -1.

Note:

Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.

If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.

You may assume start and end string is not the same.

Example 1:

start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AACCGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA"]

return: 1

Example 2:

start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AAACGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA", "AACCGCTA", "AAACGGTA"]

return: 2

Example 3:

start: "AAAAACCC"
end:   "AACCCCCC"

## Description

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to
        make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]

Output:

1

Explanation:

[1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:

Input:

[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:

Input:

[[1,2],[2,3]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

## 0436-find-right-interval.md

# 436. Find Right Interval

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/436.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/436.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j
        whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be
        called that j is on the "right" of i.

For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that
        the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for
        interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you
        need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.

You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.

Example 1:

Input:

[ [1,2] ]

Output:

[-1]

Explanation:

There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.

Example 2:

Input:

[ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]

Output:

[-1, 0, 1]

Explanation:

There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.

Example 3:

Input:

[ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]

Output:

[-1, 2, -1]

Explanation:

There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/437.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/437.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook, Microsoft, Quora, Uber, Zillow

## Description

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards
        (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to
        1,000,000.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

-3
/
\
\
3
2
11
/ \
\
3  -2
1
Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

T

and

F

(

T

and

F

represent True and False respectively).

Note:

The length of the given string is ≤ 10000.

Each number will contain only one digit.

The conditional expressions group right-to-left (as usual in most languages).

The condition will always be either

T

or

F

. That is, the
            condition will never be a digit.

The result of the expression will always evaluate to either a digit

0-9

,

T

or

F

.

Example 1:

## Description

Given an array of characters, compress it

in-place

.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a

character

(not int) of length 1.

After you are done

modifying the input array

in-place

,
        return the new length of the array.

Follow up:

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

Example 1:

Input:

["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:

Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:

"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".

Example 2:

Input:

["a"]

Output:

Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:

Nothing is replaced.

Example 3:

Input:

["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:

Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:

Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.

Note:

All characters have an ASCII value in

[35, 126]

## 0444-sequence-reconstruction.md

# 444. Sequence Reconstruction

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/444.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/444.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Check whether the original sequence

org

can be uniquely reconstructed from the
        sequences in

seqs

. The

org

sequence is a permutation of the
        integers from 1 to n, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 10

4

. Reconstruction means building a
        shortest common supersequence of the sequences in

seqs

(i.e., a shortest
        sequence so that all sequences in

seqs

are subsequences of it). Determine
        whether there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from

seqs

and it
        is the

org

sequence.

Example 1:

Input:

org: [1,2,3], seqs: [[1,2],[1,3]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

[1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed, because [1,3,2] is also a valid sequence that can be reconstructed.

Example 2:

Input:

org: [1,2,3], seqs: [[1,2]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The reconstructed sequence can only be [1,2].

Example 3:

Input:

org: [1,2,3], seqs: [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

The sequences [1,2], [1,3], and [2,3] can uniquely reconstruct the original sequence [1,2,3].

Example 4:

Input:

org: [4,1,5,2,6,3], seqs: [[5,2,6,3],[4,1,5,2]]

Output:

true

# 446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/446.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/446.html)

**Companies:** Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook

## Description

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if
        the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequences:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9

The following sequence is not arithmetic.

1, 1, 2, 5, 7

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A

subsequence

slice of that
        array is any sequence of integers (P

0

, P

1

, ..., P

k

) such
        that 0 ≤ P

0

< P

1

< ... < P

k

< N.

A

subsequence

slice (P

0

, P

1

, ..., P

k

) of array A is
        called arithmetic if the sequence A[P

0

], A[P

1

], ..., A[P

k-1

],
        A[P

k

] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that k ≥ 2.

The function should return the number of arithmetic subsequence slices in the array A.

The input contains N integers. Every integer is in the range of -2

31

and
        2

31

-1 and 0 ≤ N ≤ 1000. The output is guaranteed to be less than
        2

31

-1.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Output:
7
Explanation:
All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]

## Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
        so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network
        connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a

binary search tree

. There is no
        restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need
        to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be
        deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note:

Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize
        and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/450.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/450.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Uber, Yahoo

## Description

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the
        BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.

If the node is found, delete the node.

Note:

Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/451.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/451.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Expedia, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Uber, Yahoo

## Description

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:

"tree"

Output:

"eert"

Explanation:

'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input:

"cccaaa"

Output:

"cccaaa"

Explanation:

Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

Input:

"Aabb"

Output:

"bbAa"

Explanation:

"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/452.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/452.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Quora

## Description

There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon,
        provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's
        horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of
        the diameter suffice. Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 10

4

balloons.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon
        with x

start

and x

end

bursts by an arrow shot at x if x

start

≤ x ≤ x

end

. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An
        arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of
        arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

# 455. Assign Cookies

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/455.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/455.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you
        should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor g

i

,
        which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j
        has a size s

j

. If s

j

>= g

i

, we can assign the cookie j to
        the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your
        content children and output the maximum number.

Note:

You may assume the greed factor is always positive.

You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,2,3], [1,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,2], [1,2,3]

Output:

2

Explanation:

You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,
You need to output 2.

# 457. Circular Array Loop

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/457.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/457.html)

**Companies:** Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, Nutanix

## Description

You are given a

circular

array

nums

of positive and negative integers. If
        a number

k

at an index is positive, then move forward

k

steps. Conversely, if
        it's negative (-

k

), move backward

k

steps. Since the array is
        circular, you may assume that the last element's next element is the first element, and
        the first element's previous element is the last element.

Determine if there is a loop (or a cycle) in

nums

. A cycle must start and end at
        the same index and the cycle's length > 1. Furthermore, movements in a cycle must all
        follow a single direction. In other words, a cycle must not consist of both forward and
        backward movements.

Example 1:

Input:

[2,-1,1,2,2]

Output:

true

Explanation:

There is a cycle, from index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0. The cycle's length is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

[-1,2]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The movement from index 1 -> 1 -> 1 ... is not a cycle, because the cycle's length is 1. By definition the cycle's length must be greater than 1.

Example 3:

Input:

[-2,1,-1,-2,-2]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The movement from index 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle, because movement from index 1 -> 2 is a forward movement, but movement from index 2 -> 1 is a backward movement. All movements in a cycle must follow a single direction.

Note:

-1000 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1000

nums[i] ≠ 0

1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 5000

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/458.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/458.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest are filled with
        water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it will die within 15 minutes.
        What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket is poisonous within
        one hour?

Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.

General case:

If there are

n

buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within

m

minutes, how many pigs (

x

) you need to figure out the

poisonous

bucket within

p

minutes? There is exactly one
        bucket with poison.

Note:

A pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would like, and
            the feeding takes no time.

After a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, there has to be a

cool down
            time

of

m

minutes. During this time, only observation is allowed
            and no feedings at all.

Any given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of times (by an unlimited number of

## 0460-lfu-cache.md

# 460. LFU Cache

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/460.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/460.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Pinterest, Salesforce, Snapchat, Uber, VMware

## Description

Design and implement a data structure for

Least
        Frequently Used (LFU)

cache. It should support the following operations:

get

and

put

.

get(key)

- Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists
        in the cache, otherwise return -1.

put(key, value)

- Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.
        When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item
        before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two
        or more keys that have the same frequency), the least

recently

used key would be
        evicted.

Note that the number of times an item is used is the number of calls to
        the

get

and

put

functions for that item since
        it was inserted. This number is set to zero when the item is removed.

Follow up:

Could you do both operations in

O(1)

time complexity?

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
LFUCache cache = new LFUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3.
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1.
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3

# 464. Can I Win

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/464.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/464.html)

**Companies:** Google, LinkedIn

## Description

In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10.
        The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15
        without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given an integer

maxChoosableInteger

and another integer

desiredTotal

, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming
        both players play optimally.

You can always assume that

maxChoosableInteger

will not be larger than 20 and

desiredTotal

will not be larger than 300.

Example

Input:

maxChoosableInteger = 10
desiredTotal = 11

Output:

false

Explanation:

No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

# 465. Optimal Account Balancing

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/465.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/465.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Uber

## Description

A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice
        paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model
        each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice,
        Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the
        transactions can be represented as

[[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]

.

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of
        transactions required to settle the debt.

Note:

A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that

x ≠ y

and

z > 0

.

Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also
            have the persons 0, 2, 6.

Example 1:

Input:

[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.

Example 2:

Input:

[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.

# 468. Validate IP Address

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/468.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/468.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Uber, Visa, VMware

## Description

Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or
        neither.

IPv4

addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of
        four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."), e.g.,

172.16.254.1

;

Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address

172.16.254.01

is invalid.

IPv6

addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group
        representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons (":"). For example, the address

2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

is a valid one. Also, we could omit
        some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address
        to upper-case ones, so

2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334

is also a valid IPv6
        address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).

However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using
        two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example,

2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334

is an invalid IPv6 address.

Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address

02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

is invalid.

Note:

You may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.

Example 1:

Input:

"172.16.254.1"

Output:

"IPv4"

Explanation:

This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".

Example 2:

Input:

"2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"

Output:

"IPv6"

Explanation:

This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".

Example 3:

Input:

"256.256.256.256"

Output:

"Neither"

This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.

## 0471-encode-string-with-shortest-length.md

# 471. Encode String with Shortest Length

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/471.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/471.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a

non-empty

string, encode the string such that its encoded length is the
        shortest.

The encoding rule is:

k[encoded_string]

, where the

encoded_string

inside
        the square brackets is being repeated exactly

k

times.

Note:

k

will be a positive integer and encoded string will not be empty or have extra
            space.

You may assume that the input string contains only lowercase English letters. The string's
            length is at most 160.

If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there
            are several solutions, return any of them is fine.

Example 1:

Input: "aaa"
Output: "aaa"
Explanation: There is no way to encode it such that it is shorter than the input string, so we do not encode it.

Example 2:

Input: "aaaaa"
Output: "5[a]"
Explanation: "5[a]" is shorter than "aaaaa" by 1 character.

Example 3:

Input: "aaaaaaaaaa"
Output: "10[a]"
Explanation: "a9[a]" or "9[a]a" are also valid solutions, both of them have the same length = 5, which is the same as "10[a]".

Example 4:

Input: "aabcaabcd"
Output: "2[aabc]d"
Explanation: "aabc" occurs twice, so one answer can be "2[aabc]d".

Example 5:

Input: "abbbabbbcabbbabbbc"
Output: "2[2[abbb]c]"
Explanation: "abbbabbbc" occurs twice, but "abbbabbbc" can also be encoded to "2[abbb]c", so one answer can be "2[2[abbb]c]".

## 0480-sliding-window-median.md

# 480. Sliding Window Median

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/480.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/480.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Oracle, Snapchat

## Description

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there
        is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

Examples:

[2,3,4]

, the median is

3

[2,3]

, the median is

(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Given an array

nums

, there is a sliding window of size

k

which is moving from
        the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the

k

numbers in the
        window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Your job is to output the
        median array for each window in the original array.

For example,

Given

nums

=

[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]

, and

k

= 3.

Window position                Median
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       1
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       -1
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       -1
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       3
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       5
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      6

Therefore, return the median sliding window as

[1,-1,-1,3,5,6]

.

Note:

You may assume

k

is always valid, ie:

k

is always smaller than
        input array's size for non-empty array.

## 0481-magical-string.md

# 481. Magical String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/481.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/481.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

A magical string

S

consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string

S

is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of
        characters '1' and '2' generates the string

S

itself.

The first few elements of string

S

is the following:

S

= "1221121221221121122â¦â¦"

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in

S

, it will be:

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the

S

itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical
        string

S

.

Note:

N will not exceed 100,000.

Example 1:

Input:

6

Output:

3

Explanation:

The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.

## Description

You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric
        character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains

exactly

K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must
        contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two
        groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described
        above.

Example 1:

Input:

S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output:

"5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation:

The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

Example 2:

Input:

S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output:

"2-5G-3J"

Explanation:

The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

Note:

The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.

String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/484.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/484.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

By now, you are given a

secret signature

consisting of character 'D' and 'I'. 'D'
        represents a decreasing relationship between two numbers, 'I' represents an increasing
        relationship between two numbers. And our

secret signature

was constructed by a
        special integer array, which contains uniquely all the different number from 1 to n (n is
        the length of the secret signature plus 1). For example, the secret signature "DI" can be
        constructed by array [2,1,3] or [3,1,2], but won't be constructed by array [3,2,4] or
        [2,1,3,4], which are both illegal constructing special string that can't represent the "DI"

secret signature

.

On the other hand, now your job is to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of [1,
        2, ... n] could refer to the given

secret signature

in the input.

Example 1:

Input:

"I"

Output:

[1,2]

Explanation:

[1,2] is the only legal initial spectial string can construct secret signature "I", where the number 1 and 2 construct an increasing relationship.

Example 2:

Input:

"DI"

Output:

[2,1,3]

Explanation:

Both [2,1,3] and [3,1,2] can construct the secret signature "DI",

but since we want to find the one with the smallest lexicographical permutation, you need to output [2,1,3]

Note:

The input string will only contain the character 'D' and 'I'.

# 486. Predict the Winner

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/486.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/486.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Google, Uber

## Description

Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers
        from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time
        a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This
        continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score
        wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player
        plays to maximize his score.

Example 1:

Input:

[1, 5, 2]

Output:

False

Explanation:

Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.

If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).

So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.

Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.

Example 2:

Input:

[1, 5, 233, 7]

Output:

True

Explanation:

Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.

Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

Note:

1 <= length of the array <= 20.

Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed
            10,000,000.

If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.

## 0488-zuma-game.md

# 488. Zuma Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/488.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/488.html)

**Companies:** Baidu, Bloomberg

## Description

Think about Zuma Game. You have a row of balls on the table, colored red(R), yellow(Y),
        blue(B), green(G), and white(W). You also have several balls in your hand.

Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand, and insert it into the row (including the
        leftmost place and rightmost place). Then, if there is a group of 3 or more balls in the
        same color touching, remove these balls. Keep doing this until no more balls can be
        removed.

Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the table. If you
        cannot remove all the balls, output -1.

Examples:

Input:

"WRRBBW", "RB"

Output:

-1

Explanation:

WRRBBW -> WRR[R]BBW -> WBBW -> WBB[B]W -> WW

Input:

"WWRRBBWW", "WRBRW"

Output:

2

Explanation:

WWRRBBWW -> WWRR[R]BBWW -> WWBBWW -> WWBB[B]WW -> WWWW -> empty

Input:

"G", "GGGGG"

Output:

2

Explanation:

G -> G[G] -> GG[G] -> empty

Input:

"RBYYBBRRB", "YRBGB"

Output:

3

Explanation:

RBYYBBRRB -> RBYY[Y]BBRRB -> RBBBRRB -> RRRB -> B -> B[B] -> BB[B] -> empty

Note:

You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table wonât have any 3 or more
            consecutive balls with the same color.

The number of balls on the table won't exceed 20, and the string represents these balls
            is called "board" in the input.

The number of balls in your hand won't exceed 5, and the string represents these balls
            is called "hand" in the input.

Both input strings will be non-empty and only contain characters 'R','Y','B','G','W'.

## 0489-robot-room-cleaner.md

# 489. Robot Room Cleaner

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/489.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/489.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft

## Description

Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.

Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.

The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it
        made is 90 degrees.

When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it
        stays on the current cell.

Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs shown below.

interface Robot {
  // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
  // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.
  boolean move();

  // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
  // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
  void turnLeft();
  void turnRight();

  // Clean the current cell.
  void clean();
}

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
room = [
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
],
row = 1,
col = 3
Explanation:
All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
Notes:
The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. You
            must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must control the
            robot using only the mentioned 4 APIs, without knowing the room layout and the initial
            robot's position.
The robot's initial position will always be in an accessible cell.
The initial direction of the robot will be facing up.
All accessible cells are connected, which means the all cells marked as 1 will be
            accessible by the robot.
Assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by wall.

## 0490-the-maze.md

# 490. The Maze

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/490.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/490.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Uber

## Description

There is a

ball

in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty
        spaces by rolling

up

,

down

,

left

or

right

, but it won't stop
        rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the ball's

start position

, the

destination

and the

maze

,
        determine whether the ball could stop at the destination.

The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space.
        You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The start and destination
        coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.

Example 1:

Input 1:

a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2:

start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)

Input 3:

destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)

Output:

true

Explanation:

One possible way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.

Example 2:

Input 1:

a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2:

start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)

Input 3:

destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (3, 2)

Output:

false

Explanation:

There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination.

Note:

There is only one ball and one destination in the maze.

Both the ball and the destination exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the
            same position initially.

The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example pictures),
            but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.

The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and both the width and height of the maze won't
            exceed 100.

# 492. Construct the Rectangle

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/492.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/492.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given
        a specific rectangular web pageâs area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page,
        whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
4
Output:
[2, 2]
Explanation:
The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
Note:
The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

## 0495-teemo-attacking.md

# 495. Teemo Attacking

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/495.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/495.html)

**Companies:** Riot Games

## Description

In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in
        poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking

ascending

time series
        towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output
        the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.

You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes
        Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,4], 2

Output:

4

Explanation:

At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately.
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2.
And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds.
So you finally need to output 4.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,2], 2

Output:

3

Explanation:

At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned.
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2.
However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status.
Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3.
So you finally need to output 3.

Note:

You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.

You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning
            time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed
            10,000,000.

## 0499-the-maze-iii.md

# 499. The Maze III

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/499.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/499.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There is a

ball

in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty
        spaces by rolling

up

(u),

down

(d),

left

(l) or

right

(r), but
        it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the
        next direction. There is also a

hole

in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole
        if it rolls on to the hole.

Given the

ball position

, the

hole position

and the

maze

, find out how
        the ball could drop into the hole by moving the

shortest distance

. The distance is
        defined by the number of

empty spaces

traveled by the ball from the start position
        (excluded) to the hole (included). Output the moving

directions

by using 'u',
        'd', 'l' and 'r'. Since there could be several different shortest
        ways, you should output the

lexicographically smallest

way. If the ball cannot reach
        the hole, output "impossible".

The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space.
        You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The ball and the hole coordinates
        are represented by row and column indexes.

Example 1:

Input 1:

a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0

Input 2:

ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)

Input 3:

hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (0, 1)

Output:

"lul"

Explanation:

There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.
The first way is left -> up -> left, represented by "lul".
The second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.
Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because 'l' < 'u'. So the output is "lul".

Example 2:

Input 1:

a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0

Input 2:

ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)

Input 3:

hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (3, 0)

Output:

"impossible"

Explanation:

The ball cannot reach the hole.

Note:

There is only one ball and one hole in the maze.

Both the ball and hole exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the same

# 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/501.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/501.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the

mode(s)

(the
        most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys

less than or equal to

the node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys

greater than or equal
            to

the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:

Given BST

[1,null,2,2]

,

1
    \
     2
    /
   2

return

[2]

.

Note:

If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up:

Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit
        stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

## 0502-ipo.md

# 502. IPO

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/502.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/502.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to
        Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before
        the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most

k

distinct
        projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital
        after finishing at most

k

distinct projects.

You are given several projects. For each project

i

, it has a pure profit

P

i

and a minimum capital of

C

i

is needed to start the
        corresponding project. Initially, you have

W

capital. When you finish a project, you
        will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

To sum up, pick a list of at most

k

distinct projects from given projects to maximize
        your final capital, and output your final maximized capital.

Example 1:

Input:

k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].

Output:

4

Explanation:

Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
             Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

Note:

You may assume all numbers in the input are non-negative integers.

The length of Profits array and Capital array will not exceed 50,000.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

## 0503-next-greater-element-ii.md

# 503. Next Greater Element II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/503.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/503.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Yahoo

## Description

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the
        array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number
        x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you
        could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for
        this number.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,2,1]

Output:

[2,-1,2]

Explanation:

The first 1's next greater number is 2;

The number 2 can't find next greater number;

The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

Note:

The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

## 0505-the-maze-ii.md

# 505. The Maze II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/505.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/505.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Oracle, Snapchat

## Description

There is a

ball

in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty
        spaces by rolling

up

,

down

,

left

or

right

, but it won't stop
        rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the ball's

start position

, the

destination

and the

maze

, find
        the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by
        the number of

empty spaces

traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to
        the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.

The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space.
        You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The start and destination
        coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.

Example 1:

Input 1:

a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2:

start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)

Input 3:

destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)

Output:

12

Explanation:

One shortest way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
             The total distance is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.

Example 2:

Input 1:

a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2:

start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)

Input 3:

destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (3, 2)

Output:

-1

Explanation:

There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination.

Note:

There is only one ball and one destination in the maze.

Both the ball and the destination exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the
            same position initially.

The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example pictures),
            but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.

The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and both the width and height of the maze won't
            exceed 100.

## 0510-inorder-successor-in-bst-ii.md

# 510. Inorder Successor in BST II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/510.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/510.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg, Google, Microsoft, Quip (Salesforce)

## Description

Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the
        BST.

The successor of a node

p

is the node with the smallest key greater than

p.val

.

You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have
        a reference to its parent node.

Example 1:

Input:

root =

{"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":null,"val":1},"parent":null,"right":{"$id":"3","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":null,"val":3},"val":2}

p =

1

Output:

2

Explanation:

1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of Node type.

Example 2:

Input:

root =

{"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":{"$id":"4","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"3"},"right":null,"val":1},"parent":{"$ref":"2"},"right":null,"val":2},"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":{"$id":"5","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"2"},"right":null,"val":4},"val":3},"parent":null,"right":{"$id":"6","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":null,"val":6},"val":5}

p =

6

Output:

null

Explanation:

There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is

null

.

Example 3:

Input:

root =

{"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":{"$id":"4","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"3"},"right":null,"val":2},"parent":{"$ref":"2"},"right":{"$id":"5","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"3"},"right":null,"val":4},"val":3},"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":{"$id":"6","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"2"},"right":{"$id":"7","left":{"$id":"8","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"7"},"right":null,"val":9},"parent":{"$ref":"6"},"right":null,"val":13},"val":7},"val":6},"parent":null,"right":{"$id":"9","left":{"$id":"10","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"9"},"right":null,"val":17},"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":{"$id":"11","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"9"},"right":null,"val":20},"val":18},"val":15}

p =

15

Output:

17

Example 4:

Input:

root =

{"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":{"$id":"4","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"3"},"right":null,"val":2},"parent":{"$ref":"2"},"right":{"$id":"5","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"3"},"right":null,"val":4},"val":3},"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":{"$id":"6","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"2"},"right":{"$id":"7","left":{"$id":"8","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"7"},"right":null,"val":9},"parent":{"$ref":"6"},"right":null,"val":13},"val":7},"val":6},"parent":null,"right":{"$id":"9","left":{"$id":"10","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"9"},"right":null,"val":17},"parent":{"$ref":"1"},"right":{"$id":"11","left":null,"parent":{"$ref":"9"},"right":null,"val":20},"val":18},"val":15}

p =

13

Output:

15

Note:

If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return

null

.

It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.

Remember that we are using the

Node

type instead of

TreeNode

type so their string representation are different.

, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the

minimum

number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the

ring

is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to
        spell all the characters in the string

key

one by one by rotating the ring clockwise
        or anticlockwise to make each character of the string

key

aligned at 12:00 direction
        and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character

key[i]

:

You can rotate the

ring

clockwise or anticlockwise

one place

, which counts
            as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string

ring's

characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to
            the character

key[i]

.

If the character

key[i]

has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to
            press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you
            could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've
            finished all the spelling.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
ring = "godding", key = "gd"
Output:
4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character.
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.
Note:
Length of both ring and
key
will be in range 1 to 100.
There are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters
            in both strings.
It's guaranteed that string
key
could always be spelled by rotating the
            string
ring
.

        pass

one dress

of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines

at
            the same time

.

Given an integer array representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left
        to right on the line, you should find the

minimum number of moves

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this
        group of two strings.
        The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these
        strings and this subsequence should not be

any

subsequence of the other strings.

A

subsequence

is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some
        characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a
        subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon
        subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

Example 1:

Input:

"aba", "cdc"

Output:

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/529.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/529.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Cruise Automation, Facebook, Google, LiveRamp, Microsoft, Oracle, Uber

## Description

Let's play the minesweeper game (

Wikipedia

,

online game

)!

You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board.

'M'

represents an

unrevealed

mine,

'E'

represents an

unrevealed

empty square,

'B'

represents a

revealed

blank square that has no adjacent (above, below, left, right,
        and all 4 diagonals) mines,

digit

('1' to '8') represents how many
        mines are adjacent to this

revealed

square, and finally

'X'

represents
        a

revealed

mine.

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the

unrevealed

squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this position
        according to the following rules:

If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to

'X'

.

If an empty square ('E') with

no adjacent mines

is revealed, then change
            it to revealed blank ('B') and all of its adjacent

unrevealed

squares
            should be revealed recursively.

If an empty square ('E') with

at least one adjacent mine

is revealed,
            then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of
            adjacent mines.

Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

Example 1:

Input:

[['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']]

Click : [3,0]

Output:

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input:

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Click : [1,2]

Output:

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'X', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Explanation:

Note:

The range of the input matrix's height and width is [1,50].

The click position will only be an unrevealed square ('M' or 'E'), which
            also means the input board contains at least one clickable square.

The input board won't be a stage when game is over (some mines have been
            revealed).

For simplicity, not mentioned rules should be ignored in this problem. For example, you

don't

need to reveal all the unrevealed mines when the game is over, consider
            any cases that you will win the game or flag any squares.

## Description

Given an array of integers and an integer

k

, you need to find the number of

unique

k-diff pairs in the array. Here a

k-diff

pair is defined as an integer
        pair (i, j), where

i

and

j

are both numbers in the array and their

absolute difference

is

k

.

Example 1:

Input:

[3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2

Output:

2

Explanation:

There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).

Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of

unique

pairs.

Example 2:

Input:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1

Output:

4

Explanation:

There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 5).

Example 3:

# 533. Lonely Pixel II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/533.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/533.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, and a positive integer N, find the
        number of black pixels located at some specific row

R

and column

C

that align
        with all the following rules:

Row R and column C both contain exactly N black pixels.

For all rows that have a black pixel at column C, they should be exactly the same as
            row R

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black
        and white pixels respectively.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],
 ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']]

N = 3
Output:
6
Explanation:
All the bold 'B' are the black pixels we need (all 'B's at column 1 and 3).
        0    1    2    3    4    5         column index

'B'
, 'W',
'B'
, 'B', 'W'],
3     ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']]
row index

Take 'B' at row R = 0 and column C = 1 as an example:
Rule 1, row R = 0 and column C = 1 both have exactly N = 3 black pixels.
Rule 2, the rows have black pixel at column C = 1 are row 0, row 1 and row 2. They are exactly the same as row R = 0.
Note:
The range of width and height of the input 2D array is [1,200].

+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played

so
        far

by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player
        until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

# 544. Output Contest Matches

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/544.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/544.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

During the NBA playoffs, we always arrange the rather strong team to play with the rather
        weak team, like make the rank 1 team play with the rank n

th

team, which is a good
        strategy to make the contest more interesting. Now, you're given

n

teams, you need to
        output their

final

contest matches in the form of a string.

The

n

teams are given in the form of positive integers from 1 to n, which represents
        their initial rank. (Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team.) We'll use
        parentheses('(', ')') and commas(',') to represent the contest team pairing -
        parentheses('(' , ')') for pairing and commas(',') for partition. During the pairing process
        in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair
        with the rather weak one.

Example 1:

Input:

2

Output:

(1,2)

Explanation:

Initially, we have the team 1 and the team 2, placed like: 1,2.
Then we pair the team (1,2) together with '(', ')' and ',', which is the final answer.

Example 2:

Input:

4

Output:

((1,4),(2,3))

Explanation:

In the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the team 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.
And we got (1,4),(2,3).
In the second round, the winners of (1,4) and (2,3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.
And we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).

Example 3:

Input:

8

Output:

(((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))

Explanation:

First round: (1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)
Second round: ((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))
Third round: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))
Since the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).

Note:

The

n

is in range [2, 2

12

].

We ensure that the input

n

can be converted into the form 2

k

, where k
            is a positive integer.

## 0545-boundary-of-binary-tree.md

# 545. Boundary of Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/545.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/545.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Atlassian, eBay, Google, Microsoft, Oracle

## Description

Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in

anti-clockwise

direction
        starting from root. Boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order
        without duplicate

nodes

.  (The values of the nodes may still be
        duplicates.)

Left boundary

is defined as the path from root to the

left-most

node.

Right
        boundary

is defined as the path from root to the

right-most

node. If the root
        doesn't have left subtree or right subtree, then the root itself is left boundary or
        right boundary. Note this definition only applies to the input binary tree, and not applies
        to any subtrees.

The

left-most

node is defined as a

leaf

node you could reach when you always
        firstly travel to the left subtree if exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Repeat
        until you reach a leaf node.

The

right-most

node is also defined by the same way with left and right exchanged.

Example 1

Input:

1
   \
    2
   / \
  3   4

Ouput:

[1, 3, 4, 2]

Explanation:

The root doesn't have left subtree, so the root itself is left boundary.
The leaves are node 3 and 4.
The right boundary are node 1,2,4. Note the anti-clockwise direction means you should output reversed right boundary.
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicates and we have [1,3,4,2].

Example 2

Input:

____1_____
   /          \
  2            3
 / \          /
4   5        6
   / \      / \
  7   8    9  10

Ouput:

[1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]

Explanation:

The left boundary are node 1,2,4. (4 is the left-most node according to definition)
The leaves are node 4,7,8,9,10.
The right boundary are node 1,3,6,10. (10 is the right-most node).
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicate nodes we have [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].

# 547. Friend Circles

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/547.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/547.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Atlassian, Bloomberg, Deutsche Bank, Drawbridge, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Pocket Gems, Twitter, Two Sigma, Uber

## Description

There are

N

students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their
        friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a

direct

friend of B, and B
        is a

direct

friend of C, then A is an

indirect

friend of C. And we defined a
        friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a

N*N

matrix

M

representing the friend relationship between students in
        the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the i

th

and j

th

students are

direct

friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total
        number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

The 0

th

and 1

st

students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle.

The 2

nd

student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.

Example 2:

Input:

[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]

Output:

1

Explanation:

The 0

th

and 1

st

students are direct friends, the 1

st

and 2

nd

students are direct friends,

so the 0

th

and 2

nd

students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.

Note:

N is in range [1,200].

M[i][i] = 1 for all students.

If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.

# 548. Split Array with Equal Sum

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/548.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/548.html)

**Companies:** Alibaba

## Description

Given an array with n integers, you need to find if there are triplets (i, j, k) which
        satisfies following conditions:

0 < i, i + 1 < j, j + 1 < k < n - 1

Sum of subarrays (0, i - 1), (i + 1, j - 1), (j + 1, k - 1) and (k + 1, n - 1) should
            be equal.

where we define that subarray (L, R) represents a slice of the original array starting from the
    element indexed L to the element indexed R.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[1,2,1,2,1,2,1]
Output:
True
Explanation:
i = 1, j = 3, k = 5.
sum(0, i - 1) = sum(0, 0) = 1
sum(i + 1, j - 1) = sum(2, 2) = 1
sum(j + 1, k - 1) = sum(4, 4) = 1
sum(k + 1, n - 1) = sum(6, 6) = 1
Note:
1 <= n <= 2000.
Elements in the given array will be in range [-1,000,000, 1,000,000].
```

# 550. Game Play Analysis IV

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/550.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/550.html)

**Companies:** GSN Games

## Description

Table:

Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.

Write an SQL query that reports the

fraction

of players that logged in again
        on the day after the day they first logged in,

rounded to 2 decimal
            places

. In other words, you need to count the number of players that
        logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then
        divide that number by the total number of players.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

## 0553-optimal-division.md

# 553. Optimal Division

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/553.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/553.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Given a list of

positive integers

, the adjacent integers will perform the float
        division. For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of
        operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the

maximum

result, and
        return the corresponding expression in string format.

Your expression should NOT contain
            redundant parenthesis.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[1000,100,10,2]
Output:
"1000/(100/10/2)"
Explanation:
1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in "1000/(
(
100/10
)
/2)" are redundant,
since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return "1000/(100/10/2)".

Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2
Note:
The length of the input array is [1, 10].
Elements in the given array will be in range [2, 1000].
There is only one optimal division for each test case.

## 0554-brick-wall.md

# 554. Brick Wall

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/554.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/554.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg, Facebook, Oracle

## Description

There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of
        bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical
        line from the

top

to the

bottom

and cross the

least

bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing
        the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You
        need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of
        crossed bricks.

You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case
        the line will obviously cross no bricks.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[[1,2,2,1],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [2,4],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,1,1]]
Output:
2
Explanation:
Note:
The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range
            [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

## 0555-split-concatenated-strings.md

# 555. Split Concatenated Strings

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/555.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/555.html)

**Companies:** Alibaba

## Description

Given a list of strings, you could concatenate these strings together into a loop, where for
        each string you could choose to reverse it or not. Among all the possible loops, you need to
        find the lexicographically biggest string after cutting the loop, which will make the looped
        string into a regular one.

Specifically, to find the lexicographically biggest string, you need to experience two
        phases:

Concatenate all the strings into a loop, where you can reverse some strings or not and
            connect them in the same order as given.

Cut and make one breakpoint in any place of the loop, which will make the looped string
            into a regular one starting from the character at the cutpoint.

And your job is to find the lexicographically biggest one among all the possible regular
        strings.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
"abc", "xyz"
Output:
"zyxcba"
Explanation:
You can get the looped string "-abcxyz-", "-abczyx-", "-cbaxyz-", "-cbazyx-",
where '-' represents the looped status.
The answer string came from the fourth looped one,
where you could cut from the middle character 'a' and get "zyxcba".
Note:
The input strings will only contain lowercase letters.
The total length of all the strings will not over 1,000.

## 0558-quad-tree-intersection.md

# 558. Quad Tree Intersection

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/558.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/558.html)

**Companies:** Google, Sumologic

## Description

A quadtree is a tree data in which each internal node has exactly four children:

topLeft

,

topRight

,

bottomLeft

and

bottomRight

. Quad trees are
        often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four
        quadrants or regions.

We want to store True/False information in our quad tree. The quad tree is used to represent
        a

N * N

boolean grid. For each node, it will be subdivided into four children
        nodes

until the values in the region it represents are all the same

. Each
        node has another two boolean attributes :

isLeaf

and

val

.

isLeaf

is true if and only if the node is a leaf node. The

val

attribute for a leaf
        node contains the value of the region it represents.

For example, below are two quad trees A and B:

A:
+-------+-------+   T: true
|       |       |   F: false
|   T   |   T   |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
|       |       |
|   F   |   F   |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
topLeft: T
topRight: T
bottomLeft: F
bottomRight: F

B:
+-------+---+---+
|       | F | F |
|   T   +---+---+
|       | T | T |
+-------+---+---+
|       |       |
|   T   |   F   |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
topLeft: T
topRight:
     topLeft: F
     topRight: F
     bottomLeft: T
     bottomRight: T
bottomLeft: T
bottomRight: F

Your task is to implement a function that will take two quadtrees and return a quadtree that
        represents the logical OR (or union) of the two trees.

A:                 B:                 C (A or B):
+-------+-------+  +-------+---+---+  +-------+-------+
|       |       |  |       | F | F |  |       |       |
|   T   |   T   |  |   T   +---+---+  |   T   |   T   |
|       |       |  |       | T | T |  |       |       |
+-------+-------+  +-------+---+---+  +-------+-------+
|       |       |  |       |       |  |       |       |
|   F   |   F   |  |   T   |   F   |  |   T   |   F   |
|       |       |  |       |       |  |       |       |
+-------+-------+  +-------+-------+  +-------+-------+

Note:

Both

A

and

B

represent grids of size

N * N

.

N

is guaranteed to be a power of 2.

If you want to know more about the quad tree, you can refer to its

wiki

.

The logic OR operation is defined as this: "A or B" is true if

A is
            true

, or if

B is true

, or if

both A and B are true

## 0566-reshape-the-matrix.md

# 566. Reshape the Matrix

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/566.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/566.html)

**Companies:** Mathworks

## Description

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into
        a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two

positive

integers

r

and

c

representing the

row

number and

column

number
        of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the
        same

row-traversing

order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new
        reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:

Input:

nums =
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4

Output:

[[1,2,3,4]]

Explanation:

The

row-traversing

of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.

Example 2:

Input:

nums =
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4

Output:

[[1,2],
 [3,4]]

Explanation:

There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.

Note:

The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].

The given r and c are all positive.

## 0568-maximum-vacation-days.md

# 568. Maximum Vacation Days

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/568.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/568.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber

## Description

LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among

N

cities
        to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could
        take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to
        maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and
        restrictions you need to follow.

Rules and restrictions:

You can only travel among

N

cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1.
            Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on

Monday

.

The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a

N*N

matrix
            (not necessary symmetrical), called

flights

representing the airline status from
            the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j,

flights[i][j]
                = 0

; Otherwise,

flights[i][j] = 1

. Also,

flights[i][i] = 0

for all
            i.

You totally have

K

weeks (

each week has 7 days

) to travel. You can only
            take flights at most once

per day

and can only take flights on each week's

Monday

morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.

For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an

N*K

matrix called

days

representing this relationship. For the value of

days[i][j]

, it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city

i

in the week

j

.

You're given the

flights

matrix and

days

matrix, and you need to output the
        maximum vacation days you could take during

K

weeks.

Example 1:

Input:

flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]

Output:

12

Explanation:

Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12.

One of the best strategies is:
1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day.

(Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.)
2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.
3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.

Example 2:

Input:

flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks.

For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work.

So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.

Example 3:

Input:

flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]

Output:

21

Explanation:

Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21

One of the best strategies is:
1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days.
2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.
3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.

Note:

N and K

are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].

In the matrix

flights

, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].

In the matrix

days

, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].

You could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should

work

on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.

If you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the
            deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that
            week.

We don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days.

## 0579-find-cumulative-salary-of-an-employee.md

# 579. Find Cumulative Salary of an Employee

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/579.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/579.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

The

Employee

table holds the salary information in a year.

Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months
        but exclude the most recent month.

The result should be displayed by 'Id' ascending, and then by 'Month'
        descending.

Example

Input

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 1  | 2     | 30     |
| 2  | 2     | 30     |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
| 1  | 3     | 40     |
| 3  | 3     | 60     |
| 1  | 4     | 60     |
| 3  | 4     | 70     |

Output

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |

Explanation

Employee '1' has 3 salary records for the following 3 months except the most recent
        month '4': salary 40 for month '3', 30 for month '2' and 20 for
        month '1'

So the cumulative sum of salary of this employee over 3 months is 90(40+30+20), 50(30+20)
        and 20 respectively.

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |

Employee '2' only has one salary record (month '1') except its most recent month
    '2'.

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 2  | 1     | 20     |

Employ '3' has two salary records except its most recent pay month '4': month
    '3' with 60 and month '2' with 40. So the cumulative salary is as following.

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |

**Companies:** Twitter

## Description

A university uses 2 data tables,

student

and

department

, to store
        data about its students and the departments associated with each major.

Write a query to print the respective department name and number of students majoring in each
        department for all departments in the

department

table (even ones with no
        current students).

Sort your results by descending number of students; if two or more departments have the same
        number of students, then sort those departments alphabetically by department name.

The

student

is described as follow:

| Column Name  | Type      |
|--------------|-----------|
| student_id   | Integer   |
| student_name | String    |
| gender       | Character |
| dept_id      | Integer   |

where student_id is the student's ID number, student_name is the student's name,
        gender is their gender, and dept_id is the department ID associated with their declared
        major.

And the

department

table is described as below:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| dept_id     | Integer |
| dept_name   | String  |

where dept_id is the department's ID number and dept_name is the department name.

Here is an example

## 0582-kill-process.md

# 582. Kill Process

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/582.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/582.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Google, Microsoft

## Description

Given

n

processes, each process has a unique

PID (process id)

and its

PPID
        (parent process id)

.

Each process only has one parent process, but may have one or more children processes. This
        is just like a tree structure. Only one process has PPID that is 0, which means this process
        has no parent process. All the PIDs will be distinct positive integers.

We use two list of integers to represent a list of processes, where the first list contains
        PID for each process and the second list contains the corresponding PPID.

Now given the two lists, and a PID representing a process you want to kill, return a list of
        PIDs of processes that will be killed in the end. You should assume that when a process is
        killed, all its children processes will be killed. No order is required for the final
        answer.

Example 1:

Input:

pid =  [1, 3, 10, 5]
ppid = [3, 0, 5, 3]
kill = 5

Output:

[5,10]

Explanation:

         /   \
        1     5
             /
            10
Kill 5 will also kill 10.

Note:

The given kill id is guaranteed to be one of the given PIDs.

## 0585-investments-in-2016.md

# 585. Investments in 2016

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/585.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/585.html)

**Companies:** Twitter

## Description

Write a query to print the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (

TIV_2016

), to a
        scale of 2 decimal places, for all policy holders who meet the following criteria:

Have the same

TIV_2015

value as one or more other policyholders.

Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e.: the (latitude,
            longitude) attribute pairs must be unique).

Input Format:

The

insurance

table is described as follows:

| Column Name | Type          |
|-------------|---------------|
| PID         | INTEGER(11)   |
| TIV_2015    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| TIV_2016    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| LAT         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
| LON         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |

where

PID

is the policyholder's policy ID,

TIV_2015

is the total investment
        value in 2015,

TIV_2016

is the total investment value in 2016,

LAT

is the
        latitude of the policy holder's city, and

LON

is the longitude of the policy
        holder's city.

Sample Input

| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |

Sample Output

| TIV_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |

Explanation

The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The

TIV_2015

value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its

TIV_2015

is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of

TIV_2016

of the first and last record, which is 45.

customer_number

from the

orders

table for the customer who has
        placed the largest number of orders.

It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other
        customer.

The

orders

table is defined as follows:

| Column            | Type      |
|-------------------|-----------|
| order_number (PK) | int       |
| customer_number   | int       |

| 4            | 3               | 2017-04-18 | 2017-04-28    | 2017-04-25   | Closed |         |

Sample Output

| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |

Explanation

The customer with number '3' has two orders, which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order.
So the result is customer_number '3'.

Follow up:

What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can
        you find all the customer_number in this case?

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/587.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/587.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There are some trees, where each tree is represented by (x,y) coordinate in a two-dimensional
        garden. Your job is to fence the entire garden using the

minimum length

of rope as it
        is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if all the trees are enclosed. Your task is to
        help find the coordinates of trees which are exactly located on the fence perimeter.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]

Output:

[[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input:

[[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]

Output:

[[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]

Explanation:

Even you only have trees in a line, you need to use rope to enclose them.

Note:

All trees should be enclosed together. You cannot cut the rope to enclose trees that
            will separate them in more than one group.

All input integers will range from 0 to 100.

The garden has at least one tree.

All coordinates are distinct.

Input points have

## 0588-design-in-memory-file-system.md

# 588. Design In-Memory File System

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/588.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/588.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Baidu

## Description

Design an in-memory file system to simulate the following functions:

ls

: Given a path in string format. If it is a file path, return a list that only
        contains this file's name. If it is a directory path, return the list of file and
        directory names

in this directory

. Your output (file and directory names together)
        should in

lexicographic order

.

mkdir

: Given a

directory path

that does not exist, you should make a new
        directory according to the path. If the middle directories in the path don't exist
        either, you should create them as well. This function has void return type.

addContentToFile

: Given a

file path

and

file content

in string
        format. If the file doesn't exist, you need to create that file containing given
        content. If the file already exists, you need to

append

given content to original
        content. This function has void return type.

readContentFromFile

: Given a

file path

, return its

content

in
        string format.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
["FileSystem","ls","mkdir","addContentToFile","ls","readContentFromFile"]
[[],["/"],["/a/b/c"],["/a/b/c/d","hello"],["/"],["/a/b/c/d"]]
Output:
[null,[],null,null,["a"],"hello"]
Explanation:
Note:
You can assume all file or directory paths are absolute paths which begin with
/
and do not end with
/
except that the path is just
"/"
.

## 0591-tag-validator.md

# 591. Tag Validator

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/591.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/591.html)

**Companies:** Google, Microsoft, Uber

## Description

Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse
        the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules
        hold:

The code must be wrapped in a

valid closed tag

. Otherwise, the code is invalid.

A

closed tag

(not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format :

<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>

.
            Among them,

<TAG_NAME>

is the start tag, and

</TAG_NAME>

is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should
            be the same. A closed tag is

valid

if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT
            are valid.

A

valid

TAG_NAME

only contain

upper-case letters

, and has
            length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the

TAG_NAME

is

invalid

.

A

valid

TAG_CONTENT

may contain other

valid closed tags

,

cdata

and any characters (see note1)

EXCEPT

unmatched

<

, unmatched
            start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the

TAG_CONTENT

is

invalid

.

A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa.
            However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.

A

<

is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent

>

. And
            when you find a

<

or

</

, all the subsequent characters
            until the next

>

should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).

The cdata has the following format :

<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>

. The
            range of

CDATA_CONTENT

is defined as the characters between

<![CDATA[

and the

first subsequent

]]>

.

CDATA_CONTENT

may contain

any characters

. The function of cdata is
            to forbid the validator to parse

CDATA_CONTENT

, so even it has some
            characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it
            as

regular characters

.

Valid Code Examples:

Input:

"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>"

Output:

True

Explanation:

The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>.

The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata.

Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.

So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Input:

"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>"

Output:

True

Explanation:

We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.

start_tag ->

"<DIV>"

end_tag ->

"</DIV>"

tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.

text1 ->

">>  ![cdata[]] "

cdata ->

"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"

, where the CDATA_CONTENT is

"<div>]>"

text2 ->

"]]>>]"

The reason why start_tag is NOT

"<DIV>>>"

is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT

"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"

is because of the rule 7.

Invalid Code Examples:

Input:

"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>"

Output:

False

Explanation:

Unbalanced. If "<A>" is closed, then "<B>" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Input:

"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>"

Output:

False

Input:

"<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>"

Output:

False

Input:

"<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>"

Output:

False

Input:

"<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>"

Output:

False

Input:

"<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>"

Output:

False

Note:

For simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the

any characters

mentioned above) only contain

letters

,

digits

,

'<'

,

'>'

,

'/'

,

'!'

,

'['

,

']'

## 0592-fraction-addition-and-subtraction.md

# 592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/592.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/592.html)

**Companies:** Goldman Sachs, IXL

## Description

Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to
        return the calculation result in string format. The final result should be

irreducible fraction

.
        If your final result is an integer, say

2

, you need to change it to the format
        of fraction that has denominator

1

. So in this case,

2

should be
        converted to

2/1

.

Example 1:

Input:

"-1/2+1/2"

Output:

"0/1"

Example 2:

Input:

"-1/2+1/2+1/3"

Output:

"1/3"

Example 3:

Input:

"1/3-1/2"

Output:

"-1/6"

Example 4:

Input:

"5/3+1/3"

Output:

"2/1"

Note:

The input string only contains

'0'

to

'9'

,

'/'

,

'+'

and

'-'

. So does the output.

Each fraction (input and output) has format

Â±numerator/denominator

. If the
            first input fraction or the output is positive, then

'+'

will be omitted.

The input only contains valid

irreducible fractions

, where the

numerator

and

denominator

of each fraction will always be in the range [1,10]. If the
            denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format
            defined above.

The number of given fractions will be in the range [1,10].

The numerator and denominator of the

final result

are guaranteed to be valid and
            in the range of 32-bit int.

## 0597-friend-requests-i-overall-acceptance-rate.md

# 597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/597.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/597.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others’
    requests as well. Now given two tables as below:

Table:

friend_request

| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |

Table:

request_accepted

| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |

Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is
    the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|

Note:

The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table

friend_request

. In
            this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether
            they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the
            acceptance rate.

It is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request
            could be accepted more than once. In this case, the ‘duplicated’ requests or
            acceptances are only counted once.

If there is no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate.

Explanation:

There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. So
    the rate is 0.80.

Follow-up:

Can you write a query to return the accept rate but for every month?

How about the cumulative accept rate for every day?

## 0598-range-addition-ii.md

# 598. Range Addition II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/598.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/598.html)

**Companies:** IXL

## Description

Given an m * n matrix

M

initialized with all

0

's and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with
        two

positive

integers

a

and

b

, which means

M[i][j]

should be

added
            by one

for all

0 <= i < a

and

0 <= j < b

.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing
        all the operations.

Example 1:

Input:

m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]

Output:

4

Explanation:

Initially, M =
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M =
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M =
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

Note:

The range of m and n is [1,40000].

The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].

The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |

Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number. For the
    sample data above, the result is:

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |

Note:

It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.

The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple
            records with the same

requester_id

and

accepter_id

value.

Explanation:

The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4',
            so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.

Follow-up:

In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends, can you
            find all these people in this case?

## Description

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not.
        However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both
        would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1
        means not empty), and a number

n

, return if

n

new flowers can be planted in it
        without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Example 1:

Input:

flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1

Output:

True

Example 2:

Input:

flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2

Output:

False

Note:

The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.

The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].

n

is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

# 606. Construct String from Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/606.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/606.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with
        the preorder traversing way.

The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit
        all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship
        between the string and the original binary tree.

Example 1:

Input:

Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /
  4

Output:

"1(2(4))(3)"

Explanation:

Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())",

but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs.

And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".

Example 2:

Input:

Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \
      4

Output:

"1(2()(4))(3)"

Explanation:

Almost the same as the first example,

except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.

## 0608-tree-node.md

# 608. Tree Node

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/608.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/608.html)

**Companies:** Twitter

## Description

Given a table

tree

,

id

is identifier of the tree node and

p_id

is
        its parent node's

id

.

+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.

Root: if the node is the root of the tree.

Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id.
    The result for the above sample is:

+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+

Explanation

Node '1' is root node, because its parent node is NULL and it has child node
            '2' and '3'.

Node '2' is inner node, because it has parent node '1' and child node
            '4' and '5'.

Node '3', '4' and '5' is Leaf node, because they have parent
            node and they don't have child node.

And here is the image of the sample tree as below:

1
			/   \
                      2       3
                    /   \
                  4       5

Note

If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root
                attributes.

# 609. Find Duplicate File in System

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/609.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/609.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Google, Twitter, VMware

## Description

Given a list of directory info including directory path, and all the files with contents in
        this directory, you need to find out all the groups of duplicate files in the file system in
        terms of their paths.

A group of duplicate files consists of at least

two

files that have exactly the same
        content.

A single directory info string in the

input

list has the following format:

"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"

It means there are

n

files (

f1.txt

,

f2.txt

...

fn.txt

with content

f1_content

,

f2_content

...

fn_content

,
        respectively) in directory

root/d1/d2/.../dm

. Note that n >= 1 and m >=
        0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.

The

output

is a list of group of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all
        the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the
        following format:

"directory_path/file_name.txt"

Example 1:

Input:

["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)", "root/c 3.txt(abcd)", "root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)", "root 4.txt(efgh)"]

Output:

[["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]

Note:

No order is required for the final output.

You may assume the directory name, file name and file content only has letters and
            digits, and the length of file content is in the range of [1,50].

The number of files given is in the range of [1,20000].

You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.

You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. Directory path
            and file info are separated by a single blank space.

Follow-up beyond contest:

Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?

If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?

If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?

What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming
            part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?

How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?

# 615. Average Salary: Departments VS Company

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/615.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/615.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given two tables as below, write a query to display the comparison result (higher/lower/same) of
    the average salary of employees in a department to the company's average salary.

Table:

salary

| id | employee_id | amount | pay_date   |
|----|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1  | 1           | 9000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 2  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 3  | 3           | 10000  | 2017-03-31 |
| 4  | 1           | 7000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 5  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 6  | 3           | 8000   | 2017-02-28 |

The

employee_id

column refers to the

employee_id

in the following table

employee

.

| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 2             |
| 3           | 2             |

So for the sample data above, the result is:

| pay_month | department_id | comparison  |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2017-03   | 1             | higher      |
| 2017-03   | 2             | lower       |
| 2017-02   | 1             | same        |
| 2017-02   | 2             | same        |

Explanation

In March, the company's average salary is (9000+6000+10000)/3 = 8333.33...

The average salary for department '1' is 9000, which is the salary of

employee_id

'1' since there is only one employee in this department. So the comparison result is
    'higher' since 9000 > 8333.33 obviously.

The average salary of department '2' is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of

employee_id

'2' and '3'. So the comparison result is 'lower'
    since 8000 < 8333.33.

With he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is 'same'
    since both the department '1' and '2' have the same average salary with the
    company, which is 7000.

## 0617-merge-two-binary-trees.md

# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/617.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/617.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Huawei, Oracle

## Description

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some
        nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap,
        then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node
        will be used as the node of new tree.

Example 1:

Input:

Tree 1                     Tree 2
          1                         2
         / \                       / \
        3   2                     1   3
       /                           \   \
      5                             4   7

Output:

Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \
	 5   4   7

Note:

The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

## 0622-design-circular-queue.md

# 622. Design Circular Queue

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/622.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/622.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Citadel, Cloudera, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Splunk

## Description

Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data
        structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle
        and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also
        called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of
        the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element
        even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the
        space to store new values.

Your implementation should support following operations:

MyCircularQueue(k)

: Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.

Front

: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.

Rear

: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.

enQueue(value)

: Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if
            the operation is successful.

deQueue()

: Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the
            operation is successful.

isEmpty()

: Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.

isFull()

: Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to be 3
circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return false, the queue is full
circularQueue.Rear();  // return 3
circularQueue.isFull();  // return true
circularQueue.deQueue();  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return true
circularQueue.Rear();  // return 4
Note:
All values will be in the range of [0, 1000].
The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 1000].
Please do not use the built-in Queue library.

# 623. Add One Row to Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/623.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/623.html)

**Companies:** Gilt Groupe, Microsoft

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, then value

v

and depth

d

, you need
        to add a row of nodes with value

v

at the given depth

d

. The root
        node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth

d

, for each NOT null tree
        nodes

N

in depth

d-1

, create two tree nodes with value

v

as

N's

left subtree root and right subtree root. And

N's

original left subtree

should be the left subtree of the new left
        subtree root, its

original right subtree

should be the right subtree of the new right
        subtree root. If depth

d

is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then
        create a tree node with value

v

as the new root of the whole original tree, and the
        original tree is the new root's left subtree.

Example 1:

Input:

A binary tree as following:
       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   /
  3   1 5

v = 1

d = 2

Output:

      / \
     1   1
    /     \
   2       6
  / \     /
 3   1   5

Example 2:

Input:

A binary tree as following:
      4
     /
    2
   / \
  3   1

v = 1

d = 3

Output:

4
     /
    2
   / \
  1   1
 /     \
3       1

Note:

The given d is in range [1, maximum depth of the given tree + 1].

The given binary tree has at least one tree node.

C(row, column)

.

int Sum(int row, char column, List of Strings : numbers):

This function
        calculate and set the value at

C(row, column)

, where the value should be the
        sum of cells represented by

numbers

. This function return the sum result at

C(row, column)

. This sum formula should exist until this cell is overlapped by
        another value or another sum formula.

numbers

is a list of strings that each string represent a cell or a range of
        cells. If the string represent a single cell, then it has the following format :

ColRow

.
        For example, "F7" represents the cell at (7, F).

If the string represent a range of cells, then it has the following format :

ColRow1:ColRow2

.
        The range will always be a rectangle, and ColRow1 represent the position of the top-left
        cell, and ColRow2 represents the position of the bottom-right cell.

Example 1:

Excel(3,"C");
// construct a 3*3 2D array with all zero.
//   A B C
// 1 0 0 0
// 2 0 0 0
// 3 0 0 0

Set(1, "A", 2);
// set C(1,"A") to be 2.
//   A B C
// 1 2 0 0
// 2 0 0 0
// 3 0 0 0

Sum(3, "C", ["A1", "A1:B2"]);
// set C(3,"C") to be the sum of value at C(1,"A") and the values sum of the rectangle range whose top-left cell is C(1,"A") and bottom-right cell is C(2,"B"). Return 4.
//   A B C
// 1 2 0 0
// 2 0 0 0
// 3 0 0 4

Set(2, "B", 2);
// set C(2,"B") to be 2. Note C(3, "C") should also be changed.
//   A B C
// 1 2 0 0
// 2 0 2 0
// 3 0 0 6

Note:

You could assume that there won't be any circular sum reference. For example, A1 =
            sum(B1) and B1 = sum(A1).

The test cases are using double-quotes to represent a character.

## 0635-design-log-storage-system.md

# 635. Design Log Storage System

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/635.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/635.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Snapchat, Twitter

## Description

You are given several logs that each log contains a unique id and timestamp. Timestamp is a
        string that has the following format:

Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second

, for
        example,

2017:01:01:23:59:59

. All domains are zero-padded decimal numbers.

Design a log storage system to implement the following functions:

void Put(int id, string timestamp)

: Given a log's unique id and timestamp, store
        the log in your storage system.

int[] Retrieve(String start, String end, String granularity)

: Return the id of
        logs whose timestamps are within the range from start to end. Start and end all have the
        same format as timestamp. However, granularity means the time level for consideration. For
        example, start = "2017:01:01:23:59:59", end = "2017:01:02:23:59:59", granularity = "Day", it
        means that we need to find the logs within the range from Jan. 1st 2017 to Jan. 2nd 2017.

Example 1:

put(1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59");
put(2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59");
put(3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00");
retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01","2017:01:01:23:00:00","Year"); // return [1,2,3], because you need to return all logs within 2016 and 2017.
retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01","2017:01:01:23:00:00","Hour"); // return [1,2], because you need to return all logs start from 2016:01:01:01 to 2017:01:01:23, where log 3 is left outside the range.

Note:

There will be at most 300 operations of Put or Retrieve.

Year ranges from [2000,2017]. Hour ranges from [00,23].

Output for Retrieve has no order required.

## 0636-exclusive-time-of-functions.md

# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/636.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/636.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Uber

## Description

On a

single threaded

CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has
        a unique id between

0

and

N-1

.

We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.

Each log is a string with this format:

"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"

. 
        For example,

"0:start:3"

means the function with id

0

started at the beginning

of timestamp

3

.

"1:end:2"

means the function with id

1

ended at
            the end

of timestamp

2

.

A function's

exclusive time

is the number of units of time spent in this
        function.  Note that this does

not

include any recursive calls to
        child functions.

The CPU is

single threaded

which means that only one function is being
        executed at a given time unit.

Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 2
logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]

Output:

[3, 4]

Explanation:

Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

Note:

1 <= n <= 100

Two functions won't start or end at the same time.

Functions will always log when they exit.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/638.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/638.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a price.

However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more
        different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy
        for each item.
        The job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for

exactly

certain items as
        given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.

Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the
        price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific
        items you could get if you buy this offer.

You could use any of special offers as many times as you want.

Example 1:

Input:

[2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]

Output:

14

Explanation:

There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively.
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B.
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.

Example 2:

Input:

[2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]

Output:

11

Explanation:

The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C.
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C.
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.

Note:

There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.

For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.

You are

not

allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the
            overall price.

## 0642-design-search-autocomplete-system.md

# 642. Design Search Autocomplete System

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/642.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/642.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Lyft, Microsoft, Snapchat, Uber

## Description

Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least
        one word and end with a special character

'#'

). For

each
            character

they type

except '#'

, you need to return the

top 3

historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.
        Here are the specific rules:

The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly
            same sentence before.

The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the
            hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use
            ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).

If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.

When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you
            need to return an empty list.

Your job is to implement the following functions:

The constructor function:

AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times):

This is the constructor.
        The input is

historical data

.

Sentences

is a string array consists of
        previously typed sentences.

Times

is the corresponding times a sentence has
        been typed. Your system should record these historical data.

Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next
        character the user types:

List<String> input(char c):

The input

c

is the next character
        typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters (

'a'

to

'z'

), blank space (

' '

) or a special character
        (

'#'

). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your
        system. The output will be the

top 3

historical hot sentences that have prefix the
        same as the part of sentence already typed.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Operation:
AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman",
        "i love leetcode"], [5,3,2,2])
The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding
        times:
"i love you"
:
5
times
"island"
:
3
times
"ironman"
:
2
times
"i love leetcode"
:
2
times
Now, the user begins another search:
Operation:
input('i')
Output:
["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"]
Explanation:
There are four sentences that have prefix
"i"
. Among them, "ironman"
        and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since
' '
has
        ASCII code 32 and
'r'
has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode"
        should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences,
        so "ironman" will be ignored.
Operation:
input(' ')
Output:
["i love you","i love leetcode"]
Explanation:
There are only two sentences that have prefix
"i "
.
Operation:
input('a')
Output:
[]
Explanation:
There are no sentences that have prefix
"i a"
.
Operation:
input('#')
Output:
[]
Explanation:
The user finished the input, the sentence
"i a"
should be saved as a
        historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.
Note:
The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only
            one blank space will exist between two words.
The number of
complete sentences
that to be searched won't exceed 100. The
            length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.
Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a
            character input.
Please remember to
RESET
your class variables declared in class
            AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are
persisted across multiple test
                cases
. Please see
here
for more details.

## 0649-dota2-senate.md

# 649. Dota2 Senate

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/649.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/649.html)

**Companies:** Valve

## Description

In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the

Radiant

and the

Dire

.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the senate wants to make a
        decision about a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based
        procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise

one

of the two rights:

Ban one senator's right

:

A senator can make another senator lose

all his rights

in this and all the
            following rounds.

Announce the victory

:

If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from

the
                same party

, he can announce the victory and make the decision about the change
            in the game.

Given a string representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and
        'D' represent the

Radiant

party and the

Dire

party
        respectively. Then if there are

n

senators, the size of the given string will
        be

n

.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given
        order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost
        their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party, you
        need to predict which party will finally announce the victory and make the change in the
        Dota2 game. The output should be

Radiant

or

Dire

.

Example 1:

Input:

"RD"

Output:

"Radiant"

Explanation:

The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in the round 1.
And the second senator can't exercise any rights any more since his right has been banned.
And in the round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Example 2:

Input:

"RDD"

Output:

"Dire"

Explanation:

The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in the round 1.
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned.
And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in the round 1.
And in the round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Note:

The length of the given string will in the range [1, 10,000].

# 655. Print Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/655.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/655.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Poynt, Uber

## Description

Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules:

The row number

m

should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.

The column number

n

should always be an odd number.

The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle of the
            first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node belongs will
            separate the rest space into two parts (

left-bottom part and right-bottom part

).
            You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom part and print the right subtree in
            the right-bottom part. The left-bottom part and the right-bottom part should have the
            same size. Even if one subtree is none while the other is not, you don't need to print
            anything for the none subtree but still need to leave the space as large as that for the
            other subtree. However, if two subtrees are none, then you don't need to leave space for
            both of them.

Each unused space should contain an empty string

""

.

Print the subtrees following the same rules.

Example 1:

Input:

1
    /
   2

Output:

[["", "1", ""],
 ["2", "", ""]]

Example 2:

Input:

## 0657-robot-return-to-origin.md

# 657. Robot Return to Origin

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/657.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/657.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Google, LiveRamp

## Description

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of
        its moves, judge if this robot

ends up at (0, 0)

after it completes its
        moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith
        move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the
        origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Note

: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R"
        will always make the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move
        left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each
        move.

Example 1:

Input:

"UD"

Output:

true

Explanation

: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.

Example 2:

Input:

"LL"

Output:

false

Explanation

: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two "moves" to the left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its moves.

**Companies:** Facebook, Google, Microsoft

## Description

Implement a magic directory with

buildDict

, and

search

methods.

For the method

buildDict

, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to
        build a dictionary.

For the method

search

, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify

exactly

one character into

another

character in this word, the modified word
        is in the dictionary you just built.

Example 1:

Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False

Note:

You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters

a-z

.

For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly
            efficient algorithm after the contest.

Please remember to

RESET

your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary,
            as static/class variables are

persisted across multiple test cases

,

+

,

-

,

(

,

)

to get the value of 24.

Example 1:

Input:

[4, 1, 8, 7]

Output:

True

Explanation:

(8-4) * (7-1) = 24

Example 2:

Input:

[1, 2, 1, 2]

Output:

False

Note:

The division operator

/

represents real division, not integer division. For
            example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.

Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use

-

as a unary operator. For example, with

[1, 1, 1, 1]

as input, the
            expression

-1 - 1 - 1 - 1

is not allowed.

You cannot concatenate numbers together. For example, if the input is

[1, 2, 1,
            2]

, we cannot write this as 12 + 12.

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

Integer

(one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you
            get in this round.

"+"

(one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round
            are the sum of the last two

valid

round's points.

"D"

(one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round
            are the doubled data of the last

valid

round's points.

"C"

(an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last

valid

round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.

Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the
        round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

Example 1:

Input:

["5","2","C","D","+"]

Output:

30

Explanation:

Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.

Example 2:

Input:

["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]

Output:

27

Explanation:

Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.

Note:

The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.

Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.

# 688. Knight Probability in Chessboard

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/688.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/688.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft

## Description

On an

N

x

N

chessboard, a knight starts at the

r

-th row
        and

c

-th column and attempts to make exactly

K

moves. The rows and
        columns are 0 indexed, so the top-left square is

(0, 0)

, and the bottom-right
        square is

(N-1, N-1)

.

A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two
        squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random
        (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly

K

moves or has moved off
        the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has
        stopped moving.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
3, 2, 0, 0
Output:
0.0625
Explanation:
There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
Note:
N
will be between 1 and 25.
K
will be between 0 and 100.
The knight always initially starts on the board.

of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays
        with maximum sum.

Each subarray will be of size

k

, and we want to maximize the sum of all

3*k

entries.

Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval
        (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2
Output:
[0, 3, 5]
Explanation:
Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.
Note:
nums.length
will be between 1 and 20000.
nums[i]
will be between 1 and 65535.
k
will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).

# 690. Employee Importance

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/690.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/690.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Uber

## Description

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's

unique
        id

, his

importance value

and his

direct

subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee
        3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data
        structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []].
        Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is

not
            direct

.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the
        total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1

Output:

11

Explanation:

Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

Note:

One employee has at most one

direct

leader and may have several subordinates.

The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

# 691. Stickers to Spell Word

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/691.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/691.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, IXL

## Description

We are given N different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.

You would like to spell out the given

target

string by cutting individual
        letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.

You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of
        each sticker.

What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the

target

?
        If the task is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:

Input:

["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"

Output:

3

Explanation:

We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target "thehat".
Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.

Example 2:

Input:

["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"

Output:

-1

Explanation:

We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stickers.

Note:

stickers

has length in the range

[1, 50]

.

stickers

consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).

target

has length in the range

[1, 15]

, and consists of lowercase
        English letters.

In all test cases, all words were chosen

randomly

from the 1000 most common US
        English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.

The time limit may be more challenging than usual. It is expected that a 50 sticker test
        case can be solved within 35ms on average.

## Description

Given a non-empty list of words, return the

k

most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same
        frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

Example 1:

Input:

["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2

Output:

["i", "love"]

Explanation:

"i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

Example 2:

Input:

["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4

Output:

["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]

Explanation:

"the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

Note:

You may assume

k

is always valid, 1 ≤

k

## Description

Give a string

s

, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have
        the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are
        grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:

## 0699-falling-squares.md

# 699. Falling Squares

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/699.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/699.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Square, Uber

## Description

On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they are given.

The

i

-th square dropped (

positions[i] = (left, side_length)

) is a
        square with the left-most point being

positions[i][0]

and sidelength

positions[i][1]

.

The square is dropped with the bottom edge parallel to the number line, and from a higher
        height than all currently landed squares. We wait for each square to stick before dropping
        the next.

The squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge, and will remain fixed to any positive
        length surface they touch (either the number line or another square). Squares dropped
        adjacent to each other will not stick together prematurely.

Return a list

ans

of heights. Each height

ans[i]

represents the
        current highest height of any square we have dropped, after dropping squares represented by

positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[i]

.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1, 2], [2, 3], [6, 1]]

Output:

[2, 5, 5]

Explanation:

After the first drop of

positions[0] = [1, 2]: _aa _aa -------

The maximum
        height of any square is 2.

After the second drop of

positions[1] = [2, 3]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa__ _aa__
        --------------

The maximum height of any square is 5. The larger square stays on top
        of the smaller square despite where its center of gravity is, because squares are infinitely
        sticky on their bottom edge.

After the third drop of

positions[1] = [6, 1]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa _aa___a
        --------------

The maximum height of any square is still 5. Thus, we return an answer
        of

[2, 5, 5]

.

Example 2:

Input:

[[100, 100], [200, 100]]

Output:

[100, 100]

Explanation:

Adjacent squares don't get stuck prematurely - only their bottom edge can stick to surfaces.

Note:

1 <= positions.length <= 1000

.

1 <= positions[i][0] <= 10^8

.

1 <= positions[i][1] <= 10^6

        the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with
        that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example,

Given the tree:

       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2

You should return this subtree:

     / \
    1   3

In the example above, if we want to search the value

5

, since there is no node
        with value

5

, we should return

NULL

.

Note that an empty tree is represented by

NULL

, therefore you would see the

[]

, not

null

        guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the
        tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

For example,

Given the tree:

# 706. Design HashMap

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/706.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/706.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Atlassian, Goldman Sachs, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Reddit, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Tableau, Twitter, Uber

## Description

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

put(key, value)

: Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the
            value already exists in the HashMap, update the value.

get(key)

: Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if
            this map contains no mapping for the key.

remove(key)

: Remove the mapping for the value key if this map
            contains the mapping for the key.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
MyHashMap hashMap = new MyHashMap();
hashMap.put(1, 1);          
hashMap.put(2, 2);        
hashMap.get(1);            // returns 1
hashMap.get(3);            // returns -1 (not found)
hashMap.put(2, 1);          // update the existing value
hashMap.get(2);            // returns 1
hashMap.remove(2);          // remove the mapping for 2
hashMap.get(2);            // returns -1 (not found)
Note:
All keys and values will be in the range of
[0, 1000000]
.
The number of operations will be in the range of
[1, 10000]
.
Please do not use the built-in HashMap library.

## 0707-design-linked-list.md

# 707. Design Linked List

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/707.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/707.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle

## Description

Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use the singly linked
        list or the doubly linked list. A node in a singly linked list should have two
        attributes:

val

and

next

.

val

is the value of
        the current node, and

next

is a pointer/reference to the next
        node. If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute

prev

to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the
        linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement these functions in your linked list class:

get(index) : Get the value of the

index

-th node in the linked
            list. If the index is invalid, return

-1

.

addAtHead(val) : Add a node of value

val

before the first element of
            the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked
            list.

addAtTail(val) : Append a node of value

val

to the last element of the
            linked list.

addAtIndex(index, val) : Add a node of value

val

before the

index

-th node
            in the linked list. If

index

equals to the length of linked
            list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the
            length, the node will not be inserted. If index is negative, the node will be inserted
            at the head of the list.

deleteAtIndex(index) : Delete the

index

-th node in the linked
            list, if the index is valid.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
MyLinkedList linkedList = new MyLinkedList();
linkedList.addAtHead(1);
linkedList.addAtTail(3);
linkedList.addAtIndex(1, 2);  // linked list becomes 1->2->3
linkedList.get(1);            // returns 2
linkedList.deleteAtIndex(1);  // now the linked list is 1->3
linkedList.get(1);            // returns 3
Note:
All values will be in the range of
[1, 1000]
.
The number of operations will be in the range of
[1, 1000]
.
Please do not use the built-in LinkedList library.

# 708. Insert into a Cyclic Sorted List

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/708.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/708.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Quip (Salesforce)

## Description

Given a node from a cyclic linked list which is sorted in ascending order, write a function
        to insert a value into the list such that it remains a cyclic sorted list. The given node
        can be a reference to

any

single node in the list, and may not be necessarily the
        smallest value in the cyclic list.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the
        new value. After the insertion, the cyclic list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty (i.e., given node is

null

), you should create a new single
        cyclic list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the
        original given node.

The following example may help you understand the problem better:

In the figure above, there is a cyclic sorted list of three elements. You are given a
            reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list.

The new node should insert between node 1 and node 3. After the insertion, the list
            should look like this, and we should still return node 3.

# 711. Number of Distinct Islands II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/711.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/711.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Uber

## Description

Given a non-empty 2D array

grid

of 0's and 1's, an

island

is a group of

1

's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You
        may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of

distinct

islands. An island is considered to be the same as
        another if they have the same shape, or have the same shape after

rotation

(90, 180,
        or 270 degrees only) or

reflection

(left/right direction or up/down direction).

Example 1:

11000
10000
00001
00011

Given the above grid map, return

1

.

Notice that:

11
1

and

1
11

are considered

same

island shapes. Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise rotation on
    the first island, then two islands will have the same shapes.

Example 2:

11100
10001
01001
01110

Given the above grid map, return

2

.

Here are the two distinct islands:

111
1

and

1
1

Notice that:

111
1

and

1
111

are considered

same

island shapes. Because if we flip the first array in the up/down
    direction, then they have the same shapes.

The length of each dimension in the given

grid

does not exceed 50.

## 0712-minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings.md

# 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/712.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/712.html)

**Companies:** TripleByte

## Description

Given two strings

s1, s2

, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to
        make two strings equal.

Example 1:

Input:

s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"

Output:

231

Explanation:

Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum.
Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

Example 2:

Input:

s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"

Output:

403

Explanation:

Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
adds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

Note:

0 < s1.length, s2.length <= 1000

.

All elements of each string will have an ASCII value in

[97, 122]

## Description

Your are given an array of integers

prices

, for which the

i

-th
        element is the price of a given stock on day

i

; and a non-negative integer

fee

representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee
        for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must
        sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

Example 1:

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/715.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/715.html)

**Companies:** Coupang, Google, LinkedIn, Machine Zone, Oracle

## Description

A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Your task is to design and
        implement the following interfaces in an efficient manner.

addRange(int left, int right)

Adds the half-open interval

[left,
        right)

, tracking every real number in that interval. Adding an interval that
        partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the interval

[left, right)

that are not already tracked.

queryRange(int left, int right)

Returns true if and only if every real number
        in the interval

[left, right)

is currently being tracked.

removeRange(int left, int right)

Stops tracking every real number currently
        being tracked in the interval

[left, right)

.

Example 1:

addRange(10, 20)

: null

removeRange(14, 16)

: null

queryRange(10, 14)

: true (Every number in [10, 14) is being tracked)

queryRange(13, 15)

: false (Numbers like 14, 14.03, 14.17 in [13, 15) are not being tracked)

queryRange(16, 17)

: true (The number 16 in [16, 17) is still being tracked, despite the remove operation)

Note:

A half open interval

[left, right)

denotes all real numbers

left <= x <
        right

.

0 < left < right < 10^9

in all calls to

addRange, queryRange,
        removeRange

.

The total number of calls to

addRange

in a single test case is at most

1000

.

The total number of calls to

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/721.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/721.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Houzz, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle

## Description

Given a list

accounts

, each element

accounts[i]

is a list of
        strings, where the first element

accounts[i][0]

is a

name

, and the rest
        of the elements are

emails

representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person
        if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have
        the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A
        person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have
        the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of
        each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails

in sorted order

.
        The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]

Output:

[["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]

Explanation:

The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'],
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.

Note:

The length of

accounts

will be in the range

[1, 1000]

.

The length of

accounts[i]

will be in the range

[1, 10]

.

The length of

accounts[i][j]

will be in the range

[1, 30]

.

## 0722-remove-comments.md

# 722. Remove Comments

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/722.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/722.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Google, HBO, Microsoft, Oracle, Qualtrics, Uber

## Description

Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program

source

is an array
        where

source[i]

is the

i

-th line of the source code. This
        represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character

\n

.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string

//

denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the
        characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.

The string

/*

denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters
        until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of

*/

should be ignored. (Here,
        occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the
        string

/*/

does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be
        overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string

//

occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string

/*

occurs in
        a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line:
        each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters. For example,

source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";"

will not be a test case. (Also,
        nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so

/*

outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the
        examples below for details.

After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same
        format.

Example 1:

Input:

source = ["/*Test program */", "int main()", "{ ", "  // variable declaration ", "int a, b, c;", "/* This is a test", "   multiline  ", "   comment for ", "   testing */", "a = b + c;", "}"]

The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{
  // variable declaration
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline
   comment for
   testing */
a = b + c;
}

Output:

["int main()","{ ","  ","int a, b, c;","a = b + c;","}"]

The line by line code is visualized as below:
int main()
{

int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}

Explanation:

The string

/*

denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string

//

denotes line 4 as comments.

Example 2:

Input:

source = ["a/*comment", "line", "more_comment*/b"]

Output:

["ab"]

Explanation:

The original source string is "a/*comment

\n

line

\n

more_comment*/b", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the

implicit

newline characters are deleted, leaving the string "ab", which when delimited by newline characters becomes ["ab"].

Note:

The length of

source

is in the range

[1, 100]

.

The length of

source[i]

is in the range

[0, 80]

.

Every open block comment is eventually closed.

There are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.

## 0723-candy-crush.md

# 723. Candy Crush

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/723.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/723.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg, Google, Rubrik

## Description

This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.

Given a 2D integer array

board

representing the grid of candy, different
        positive integers

board[i][j]

represent different types of candies. A value of

board[i][j] = 0

represents that the cell at position

(i, j)

is
        empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move.
        Now, you need to restore the board to a

stable state

by crushing candies according to
        the following rules:

If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally,
            "crush" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.

After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on
            top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same
            time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)

After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need
            to repeat the above steps.

If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is

stable

),
            then return the current board.

You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current
        board.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
board =
[[110,5,112,113,114],[210,211,5,213,214],[310,311,3,313,314],[410,411,412,5,414],[5,1,512,3,3],[610,4,1,613,614],[710,1,2,713,714],[810,1,2,1,1],[1,1,2,2,2],[4,1,4,4,1014]]
Output:
[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[110,0,0,0,114],[210,0,0,0,214],[310,0,0,113,314],[410,0,0,213,414],[610,211,112,313,614],[710,311,412,613,714],[810,411,512,713,1014]]
Explanation:
Note:
The length of
board
will be in the range [3, 50].
The length of
board[i]
will be in the range [3, 50].
Each
board[i][j]
will initially start as an integer in the range [1, 2000].

# 724. Find Pivot Index

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/724.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/724.html)

**Companies:** Apple, Baidu, Bloomberg, Coupang, Expedia, Facebook, GoDaddy, Goldman Sachs, Google, Indeed, Microsoft, Radius, Salesforce, Tesla

## Description

Given an array of integers

nums

, write a method that returns the "pivot"
        index of this array.

We define the pivot index as the index where the sum of the numbers to the left of the index
        is equal to the sum of the numbers to the right of the index.

If no such index exists, we should return -1. If there are multiple pivot indexes, you should
        return the left-most pivot index.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]

Output:

3

Explanation:

The sum of the numbers to the left of index 3 (nums[3] = 6) is equal to the sum of numbers to the right of index 3.
Also, 3 is the first index where this occurs.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1, 2, 3]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.

Note:

The length of

nums

will be in the range

[0, 10000]

.

Each element

nums[i]

will be an integer in the range

[-1000,
            1000]

## 0725-split-linked-list-in-parts.md

# 725. Split Linked List in Parts

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/725.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/725.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Google

## Description

Given a (singly) linked list with head node

root

, write a function to split the
        linked list into

k

consecutive linked list "parts".

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size
        differing by more than 1. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier
        should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.

Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are formed.

Examples
    1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts
    [ [1],
    [2],
    [3],
    [4],
    null ]

Example 1:

Input:

root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5

Output:

[[1],[2],[3],[],[]]

Explanation:

The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.
For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2, \root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a ListNode is [].

Example 2:

Input:

root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3

Output:

[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]

Explanation:

The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.

Note:

The length of

root

will be in the range

[0, 1000]

.

Each value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range

[0, 999]

.

k

will be an integer in the range

[1, 50]

## 0726-number-of-atoms.md

# 726. Number of Atoms

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/726.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/726.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Pinterest

## Description

Given a chemical

formula

(given as a string), return the count of each atom.

An atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase
        letters, representing the name.

1 or more digits representing the count of that element may follow if the count is greater
        than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow. For example, H2O and H2O2 are possible,
        but H1O2 is impossible.

Two formulas concatenated together produce another formula. For example, H2O2He3Mg4 is also
        a formula.

A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula. For
        example, (H2O2) and (H2O2)3 are formulas.

Given a formula, output the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the
        first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed
        by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1),
        and so on.

Example 1:

Input:

formula = "H2O"

Output:

"H2O"

Explanation:

The count of elements are {'H': 2, 'O': 1}.

Example 2:

Input:

formula = "Mg(OH)2"

Output:

"H2MgO2"

Explanation:

The count of elements are {'H': 2, 'Mg': 1, 'O': 2}.

Example 3:

Input:

formula = "K4(ON(SO3)2)2"

Output:

"K4N2O14S4"

Explanation:

The count of elements are {'K': 4, 'N': 2, 'O': 14, 'S': 4}.

Note:

All atom names consist of lowercase letters, except for the first character which is
        uppercase.

The length of

formula

will be in the range

[1, 1000]

.

formula

will only consist of letters, digits, and round parentheses, and is a
        valid formula as defined in the problem.

T

, find the minimum (contiguous)

substring

W

of

S

, so that

T

is a

subsequence

of

W

.

If there is no such window in

that covers all characters in

T

,
        return the empty string

""

. If there are multiple such minimum-length
        windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

Example 1:

Input:

S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"

Output:

"bcde"

Explanation:

"bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
"deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.

Note:

All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.

The length of

S

will be in the range

## Description

A

self-dividing number

is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because

128 % 1 == 0

,

128 % 2
        == 0

, and

128 % 8 == 0

.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number,
        including the bounds if possible.

Example 1:

Input:

left = 1, right = 22

Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]

# 729. My Calendar I

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/729.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/729.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Google, Intuit, Microsoft, Uber

## Description

Implement a

MyCalendar

class to store your events. A new event can be added if
        adding the event will not cause a double booking.

Your class will have the method,

book(int start, int end)

. Formally, this
        represents a booking on the half open interval

[start, end)

, the range of real
        numbers

x

such that

start <= x < end

.

A

double booking

happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there
        is some time that is common to both events.)

For each call to the method

MyCalendar.book

, return

true

if the
        event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise,
        return

false

and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this:

MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar();

MyCalendar.book(start,
    end)

Example 1:

MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(20, 30); // returns true

Explanation:

The first event can be booked.  The second can't because time 15 is already booked by another event.
The third event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.

Note:

The number of calls to

MyCalendar.book

per test case will be at most

1000

.

In calls to

# 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/730.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/730.html)

**Companies:** LinkedIn, Pure Storage

## Description

Given a string S, find the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in S, and

return that number modulo

10^9 + 7

.

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences

A_1, A_2, ...

and

B_1, B_2, ...

are different if
        there is some

i

for which

A_i != B_i

.

Example 1:

Input:

S = 'bccb'

Output:

6

Explanation:

The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.

Example 2:

Input:

S = 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba'

Output:

104860361

Explanation:

There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note:

The length of

S

will be in the range

[1, 1000]

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/731.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/731.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

Implement a

MyCalendarTwo

class to store your events. A new event can be added
        if adding the event will not cause a

triple

booking.

Your class will have one method,

book(int start, int end)

. Formally, this
        represents a booking on the half open interval

[start, end)

, the range of real
        numbers

x

such that

start <= x < end

.

A

triple booking

happens when

three

events have some non-empty intersection
        (ie., there is some time that is common to all 3 events.)

For each call to the method

MyCalendar.book

, return

true

if the
        event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a

triple

booking.
        Otherwise, return

false

and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this:

MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar();

MyCalendar.book(start,
    end)

Example 1:

MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(50, 60); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(10, 40); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(5, 15); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(5, 10); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(25, 55); // returns true

Explanation:

The first two events can be booked.  The third event can be double booked.
The fourth event (5, 15) can't be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.
The fifth event (5, 10) can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
The sixth event (25, 55) can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event;
the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time [50, 55) will be double booked with the second event.

Note:

The number of calls to

MyCalendar.book

per test case will be at most

1000

.

In calls to

class to store your events. A new event can

always

be added.

Your class will have one method,

book(int start, int end)

. Formally, this
        represents a booking on the half open interval

[start, end)

, the range of real
        numbers

x

such that

start <= x < end

.

A

K-booking

happens when

K

events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there
        is some time that is common to all K events.)

For each call to the method

MyCalendar.book

, return an integer

K

representing the largest integer such that there exists a

K

-booking in the
        calendar.

Your class will be called like this:

MyCalendarThree cal = new MyCalendarThree();

MyCalendarThree.book(start, end)

Example 1:

MyCalendarThree();
MyCalendarThree.book(10, 20); // returns 1
MyCalendarThree.book(50, 60); // returns 1
MyCalendarThree.book(10, 40); // returns 2
MyCalendarThree.book(5, 15); // returns 3
MyCalendarThree.book(5, 10); // returns 3
MyCalendarThree.book(25, 55); // returns 3

Explanation:

The first two events can be booked and are disjoint, so the maximum K-booking is a 1-booking.
The third event [10, 40) intersects the first event, and the maximum K-booking is a 2-booking.
The remaining events cause the maximum K-booking to be only a 3-booking.
Note that the last event locally causes a 2-booking, but the answer is still 3 because
eg. [10, 20), [10, 40), and [5, 15) are still triple booked.

Note:

The number of calls to

MyCalendarThree.book

per test case will be at most

400

.

In calls to

MyCalendarThree.book(start, end)

,

start

and

end

are integers in the range

[0, 10^9]

.

# 733. Flood Fill

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/733.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/733.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Qualtrics, Snapchat, Uber

## Description

An

image

is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing
        the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

Given a coordinate

(sr, sc)

representing the starting pixel (row and column) of
        the flood fill, and a pixel value

newColor

, "flood fill" the image.

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected
        4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any
        pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting
        pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

At the end, return the modified image.

Example 1:

Input:

image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2

Output:

[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

Explanation:

From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.

Note:

The length of

image

and

image[0]

will be in the range

[1,
        50]

.

The given starting pixel will satisfy

0 <= sr < image.length

and

0 <= sc
        < image[0].length

.

The value of each color in

image[i][j]

and

newColor

will be an
        integer in

[0, 65535]

.

## 0734-sentence-similarity.md

# 734. Sentence Similarity

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/734.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/734.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given two sentences

words1, words2

(each represented as an array of strings),
        and a list of similar word pairs

pairs

, determine if two sentences are similar.

For example, "great acting skills" and "fine drama talent" are similar,
        if the similar word pairs are

pairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"],
            ["skills","talent"]]

.

Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if "great" and
        "fine" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, "great"
        and "good" are

not

necessarily similar.

However, similarity is symmetric. For example, "great" and "fine" being
        similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences

words1 = ["great"],
        words2 = ["great"], pairs = []

are similar, even though there are no
        specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence
        like

words1 = ["great"]

can never be similar to

words2 = ["doubleplus","good"]

.

Note:

The length of

words1

and

words2

will not exceed

1000

.

The length of

pairs

will not exceed

2000

.

The length of each

pairs[i]

will be

The length of each

words[i]

and

will be in the
            range

[1, 20]

## 0735-asteroid-collision.md

# 735. Asteroid Collision

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/735.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/735.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, eBay, Lyft, Uber, Visa

## Description

We are given an array

asteroids

of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its
        direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same
        speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller
        one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the
        same direction will never meet.

Example 1:

Input:

asteroids = [5, 10, -5]

Output:

[5, 10]

Explanation:

The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.  The 5 and 10 never collide.

Example 2:

Input:

asteroids = [8, -8]

Output:

[]

Explanation:

The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

Example 3:

Input:

asteroids = [10, 2, -5]

Output:

[10]

Explanation:

The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5.  The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.

Example 4:

Input:

asteroids = [-2, -1, 1, 2]

Output:

[-2, -1, 1, 2]

Explanation:

The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right.
Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.

Note:

The length of

asteroids

will be at most

10000

.

Each asteroid will be a non-zero integer in the range

[-1000, 1000].

## 0736-parse-lisp-expression.md

# 736. Parse Lisp Expression

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/736.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/736.html)

**Companies:** Affirm, Google

## Description

You are given a string

expression

representing a Lisp-like expression to return
        the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression,
        or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.

(An integer could be positive or negative.)

A let-expression takes the form

(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)

, where

let

is always the string

"let"

, then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating
        variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable

v1

is assigned the
        value of the expression

e1

, the second variable

v2

is assigned the
        value of the expression

e2

, and so on

sequentially

; and then the value
        of this let-expression is the value of the expression

expr

.

An add-expression takes the form

(add e1 e2)

where

add

is always
        the string

"add"

, there are always two expressions

e1, e2

, and
        this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of

e1

and the
        evaluation of

e2

.

A mult-expression takes the form

(mult e1 e2)

where

mult

is always
        the string

"mult"

, there are always two expressions

e1, e2

, and
        this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of

e1

and the
        evaluation of

e2

.

For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A
        variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.
        Additionally for your convenience, the names "add", "let", or "mult" are protected and will
        never be used as variable names.

Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated,

within the context of that evaluation

, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses)
        is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked
        sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for
        more details on scope.

Evaluation Examples:

Input:

(add 1 2)

Output:

3

Input:

(mult 3 (add 2 3))

Output:

15

Input:

(let x 2 (mult x 5))

Output:

10

Input:

(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))

Output:

14

Explanation:

In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

Input:

(let x 3 x 2 x)

Output:

2

Explanation:

Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

Input:

(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))

Output:

5

Explanation:

The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

Input:

(let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))

Output:

6

Explanation:

Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context
of the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.

Input:

(let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2)

Output

4

Explanation:

Variable names can contain digits after the first character.

Note:

The given string

expression

is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing
        spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no
        space between adjacent parentheses. The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to
        an integer.

The length of

expression

is at most 2000. (It is also non-empty, as that would
        not be a legal expression.)

The answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a
        32-bit integer.

## 0741-cherry-pickup.md

# 741. Cherry Pickup

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/741.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/741.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Akuna Capital, Amazon, Apple, Citrix, Flipkart, Google, Mathworks, Oracle, Uber

## Description

In a N x N

grid

representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three
        possible integers.

0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;

1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;

-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:

Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) by moving right or down through
            valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);

After reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path
            cells;

When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell
            becomes an empty cell (0);

If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be
            collected.

Example 1:

Input:

grid =
[[0, 1, -1],
 [1, 0, -1],
 [1, 1,  1]]

Output:

5

Explanation:

The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.

Note:

grid

is an

N

by

N

2D array, with

1 <= N
            <= 50

.

Each

grid[i][j]

# 742. Closest Leaf in a Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/742.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/742.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Databricks, Facebook, Google

## Description

Given a binary tree

where every node has a unique value

, and a target key

k

, find the value of the nearest leaf node to target

k

in the
        tree.

Here,

nearest

to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree
        to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a

leaf

if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row.
        The actual

root

tree given will be a TreeNode object.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
Diagram of binary tree:
          1
         / \
        3   2

Output:

2 (or 3)

Explanation:

Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [1], k = 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Diagram of binary tree:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          /
         4
        /
       5
      /
     6

Output:

3

Explanation:

The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.

Note:

root

represents a binary tree with at least

1

node and at most

1000

nodes.

Every node has a unique

node.val

in range

[1, 1000]

.

There exists some node in the given binary tree for which

node.val == k

.

## Description

In a given integer array

nums

, there is always exactly one largest element.

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number
        in the array.

If it is, return the

index

of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

Example 1:

Output:

1

Explanation:

6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

## 0748-shortest-completing-word.md

# 748. Shortest Completing Word

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/748.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/748.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Find the minimum length word from a given dictionary

words

, which has all the
        letters from the string

licensePlate

. Such a word is said to

complete

the given string

licensePlate

Here, for letters we ignore case. For example,

"P"

on the

licensePlate

still matches

"p"

on the word.

It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, return the one that occurs
        first in the array.

The license plate might have the same letter occurring multiple times. For example, given a

licensePlate

of

"PP"

, the word

"pair"

does not
        complete the

licensePlate

, but the word

"supper"

does.

Example 1:

Input:

licensePlate = "1s3 PSt", words = ["step", "steps", "stripe", "stepple"]

Output:

"steps"

Explanation:

The smallest length word that contains the letters "S", "P", "S", and "T".
Note that the answer is not "step", because the letter "s" must occur in the word twice.
Also note that we ignored case for the purposes of comparing whether a letter exists in the word.

Example 2:

Input:

licensePlate = "1s3 456", words = ["looks", "pest", "stew", "show"]

Output:

"pest"

Explanation:

There are 3 smallest length words that contains the letters "s".
We return the one that occurred first.

Note:

licensePlate

will be a string with length in range

[1, 7]

.

licensePlate

will contain digits, spaces, or letters (uppercase or
            lowercase).

# 749. Contain Virus

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/749.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/749.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg

## Description

A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing
        walls.

The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where

0

represents uninfected
        cells, and

1

represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one
        wall) can be installed

between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells

, on the shared
        boundary.

Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless
        blocked by a wall.
        Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the
        affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells
        the following night. There will never be a tie.

Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world
        becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.

Example 1:

Input:

grid =
[[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Output:

10

Explanation:

There are 2 contaminated regions.
On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:

[[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]

On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.

Example 2:

Input:

grid =
[[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]

Output:

4

Explanation:

Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.
Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.

Example 3:

Input:

grid =
[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
 [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Output:

13

Explanation:

The region on the left only builds two new walls.

Note:

The number of rows and columns of

grid

will each be in the range

[1,
            50]

.

Each

grid[i][j]

will be either

0

or

1

.

Throughout the described process, there is always a contiguous viral region that will
            infect

strictly more

uncontaminated squares in the next round.

## 0751-ip-to-cidr.md

# 751. IP to CIDR

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/751.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/751.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb

## Description

Given a start IP address

ip

and a number of ips we need to cover

n

,
        return a representation of the range as a list (of smallest possible length) of CIDR blocks.

A CIDR block is a string consisting of an IP, followed by a slash, and then the prefix
        length. For example: "123.45.67.89/20". That prefix length "20" represents the number of
        common prefix bits in the specified range.

Example 1:

Input:

ip = "255.0.0.7", n = 10

Output:

["255.0.0.7/32","255.0.0.8/29","255.0.0.16/32"]

Explanation:

The initial ip address, when converted to binary, looks like this (spaces added for clarity):
255.0.0.7 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000111
The address "255.0.0.7/32" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just this one address.

The address "255.0.0.8/29" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 29 bits to the given address:
255.0.0.8 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
Addresses with common prefix of 29 bits are:
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001001
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001010
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001011
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001100
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001101
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001110
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001111

The address "255.0.0.16/32" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just 11111111 00000000 00000000 00010000.

In total, the answer specifies the range of 10 ips starting with the address 255.0.0.7 .

There were other representations, such as:
["255.0.0.7/32","255.0.0.8/30", "255.0.0.12/30", "255.0.0.16/32"],
but our answer was the shortest possible.

Also note that a representation beginning with say, "255.0.0.7/30" would be incorrect,
because it includes addresses like 255.0.0.4 = 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000100
that are outside the specified range.

Note:

ip

will be a valid IPv4 address.

Every implied address

ip + x

(for

x < n

) will be a valid IPv4
            address.

n

will be an integer in the range

[1, 1000]

.

## 0752-open-the-lock.md

# 752. Open the Lock

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/752.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/752.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Uber

## Description

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots:

'0',
        '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'

. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap
        around: for example we can turn

'9'

to be

'0'

, or

'0'

to be

'9'

. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at

'0000'

, a string representing the state of the 4
        wheels.

You are given a list of

deadends

dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of
        these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a

target

representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock,
        return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is
        impossible.

Example 1:

Input:

deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"

Output:

6

Explanation:

A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".

Example 2:

Input:

deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"

Output:

1

Explanation:

We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".

Example 3:

Input:

deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"

Output:

-1

Explanation:

We can't reach the target without getting stuck.

Example 4:

Input:

deadends = ["0000"], target = "8888"

Output:

-1

Note:

The length of

deadends

will be in the range

[1, 500]

.

target

will not be in the list

deadends

.

Every string in

deadends

and the string

target

will be a
            string of 4 digits from the 10,000 possibilities

'0000'

to

'9999'

.

# 755. Pour Water

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/755.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/755.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Robinhood

## Description

We are given an elevation map,

heights[i]

representing the height of the
        terrain at that index. The width at each index is 1. After

V

units of water
        fall at index

K

, how much water is at each index?

Water first drops at index

K

and rests on top of the highest terrain or water
        at that index. Then, it flows according to the following rules:

If the droplet would eventually fall by moving left, then move left.

Otherwise, if the droplet would eventually fall by moving right, then move right.

Otherwise, rise at it's current position.

Here, "eventually fall" means that the droplet will eventually be at a lower level if it moves
    in that direction.
    Also, "level" means the height of the terrain plus any water in that column.

We can assume there's infinitely high terrain on the two sides out of bounds of the array. Also,
    there could not be partial water being spread out evenly on more than 1 grid block - each unit
    of water has to be in exactly one block.

Example 1:

Input:

heights = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2], V = 4, K = 3

Output:

[2,2,2,3,2,2,2]

Explanation:

#       #
#       #
##  # ###
#########
 0123456    <- index

The first drop of water lands at index K = 3:

#       #
#   w   #
##  # ###
#########
 0123456

When moving left or right, the water can only move to the same level or a lower level.
(By level, we mean the total height of the terrain plus any water in that column.)
Since moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left.
(A droplet "made to fall" means go to a lower height than it was at previously.)

#       #
#       #
## w# ###
#########
 0123456

Since moving left will not make it fall, it stays in place.  The next droplet falls:

#       #
#   w   #
## w# ###
#########
 0123456

Since the new droplet moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left.
Notice that the droplet still preferred to move left,
even though it could move right (and moving right makes it fall quicker.)

#       #
#  w    #
## w# ###
#########
 0123456

#       #
#       #
##ww# ###
#########
 0123456

After those steps, the third droplet falls.
Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right.
Since moving right would eventually make it fall, it moves right.

#       #
#   w   #
##ww# ###
#########
 0123456

#       #
#       #
##ww#w###
#########
 0123456

Finally, the fourth droplet falls.
Since moving left would not eventually make it fall, it tries to move right.
Since moving right would not eventually make it fall, it stays in place:

#       #
#   w   #
##ww#w###
#########
 0123456

The final answer is [2,2,2,3,2,2,2]:

    #
 #######
 #######
 0123456

Example 2:

Input:

heights = [1,2,3,4], V = 2, K = 2

Output:

[2,3,3,4]

Explanation:

The last droplet settles at index 1, since moving further left would not cause it to eventually fall to a lower height.

Example 3:

Input:

heights = [3,1,3], V = 5, K = 1

Output:

[4,4,4]

Note:

heights

will have length in

[1, 100]

and contain integers in

[0, 99]

.

V

will be in range

[0, 2000]

.

K

will be in range

[0, heights.length - 1]

.

## 0756-pyramid-transition-matrix.md

# 756. Pyramid Transition Matrix

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/756.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/756.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Google

## Description

We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter
        string.

We are allowed to place any color block

C

on top of two adjacent blocks of
        colors

A

and

B

, if and only if

ABC

is an allowed
        triple.

We start with a bottom row of

bottom

, represented as a single string. We also
        start with a list of allowed triples

allowed

. Each allowed triple is
        represented as a string of length 3.

Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.

Example 1:

Input:

bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG", "CDE", "GEA", "FFF"]

Output:

true

Explanation:

We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  G   E
 / \ / \
B   C   D

We are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.

Example 2:

Input:

bottom = "AABA", allowed = ["AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAC"]

Output:

false

Explanation:

We can't stack the pyramid to the top.
Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.

Note:

bottom

will be a string with length in range

[2, 8]

.

allowed

will have length in range

[0, 200]

.

Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set

{'A', 'B',
            'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}

# 757. Set Intersection Size At Least Two

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/757.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/757.html)

**Companies:** Drawbridge, Uber

## Description

An integer interval

[a, b]

(for integers

a < b

) is a set of all
        consecutive integers from

a

to

b

, including

a

and

b

.

Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in

intervals

, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.

Example 1:

Input:

intervals = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.
Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]

Output:

5

Explanation:

An example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Note:

intervals

will have length in range

[1, 3000]

.

intervals[i]

will have length

2

, representing some integer
            interval.

intervals[i][j]

will be an integer in

## Description

Given a set of keywords

words

and a string

S

, make all appearances

For example, given that

words = ["ab", "bc"]

and

S = "aabcd"

, we
        should return

"a<b>abc</b>d"

. Note that returning

"a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d"

would use more tags, so it is incorrect.

# 759. Employee Free Time

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/759.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/759.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Bloomberg, DoorDash, Google, Intuit, Microsoft, Pinterest, Uber, Wayfair

## Description

We are given a list

schedule

of employees, which represents the working time for
        each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping

Intervals

, and these intervals are
        in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing

common, positive-length free time

for

all

employees, also in sorted order.

Example 1:

Input:

schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]

Output:

[[3,4]]

Explanation:

There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.

Example 2:

Input:

schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]

Output:

[[5,6],[7,9]]

(Even though we are representing

Intervals

in the form

[x, y]

, the
        objects inside are

Intervals

, not lists or arrays. For example,

schedule[0][0].start
            = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2

, and

schedule[0][0][0]

is not defined.)

Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero
        length.

Note:

schedule

and

schedule[i]

are lists with lengths in range

[1, 50]

.

0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8

.

# 761. Special Binary String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/761.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/761.html)

**Companies:** Citrix, Coursera, Quip (Salesforce), Visa

## Description

Special

binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.

Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

Given a special string

S

, a

move

consists of choosing two consecutive,
    non-empty, special substrings of

S

, and swapping them.

(Two strings are
    consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first
    character of the second string.)

At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string
        possible?

Example 1:

Input:

S = "11011000"

Output:

"11100100"

Explanation:

The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.

Note:

S

has length at most

50

.

S

is guaranteed to be a

special

binary string as defined above.

# 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/762.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/762.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Given two integers

L

and

R

, find the count of numbers in the range

[L, R]

(inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary
        representation.

(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of

1

s present
        when written in binary. For example,

21

written in binary is

10101

which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)

Example 1:

Input:

L = 6, R = 10

Output:

4

Explanation:

6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)

Example 2:

Input:

L = 10, R = 15

Output:

5

Explanation:

10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)

Note:

L, R

will be integers

L <= R

in the range

[1,

S

of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into

Explanation:

The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

# 768. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/768.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/768.html)

**Companies:** Google, Microsoft

## Description

This question is the same as "Max Chunks to Make Sorted" except the integers of
        the given array are not necessarily distinct, the input array could be up to length

2000

,
        and the elements could be up to

10**8

.

Given an array

arr

of integers (

not necessarily distinct

), we
        split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort
        each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [5,4,3,2,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [2,1,3,4,4]

Output:

4

Explanation:

We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.

Note:

arr

will have length in range

[1, 2000]

.

arr[i]

will be an integer in range

[0, 10**8]

.

## Description

Given an array

arr

that is a permutation of

[0, 1, ..., arr.length -
        1]

, we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and
        individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the
        sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [4,3,2,1,0]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,0,2,3,4]

Output:

4

Explanation:

We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.

Note:

arr

## 0770-basic-calculator-iv.md

# 770. Basic Calculator IV

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/770.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/770.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Indeed, Intuit, Pinterest

## Description

Given an

expression

such as

expression = "e + 8 - a +
        5"

and an evaluation map such as

{"e": 1}

(given in terms
        of

evalvars = ["e"]

and

evalints = [1]

), return a list
        of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as

["-1*a","14"]

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and
            symbol.

A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.

A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables
            can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or
            unary operator like

"2x"

or

"-x"

.

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then
        addition and subtraction. For example,

expression = "1 + 2 * 3"

has
        an answer of

["7"]

.

The format of the output is as follows:

For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables
            within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a
            term like

"b*a*c"

, only

"a*b*c"

.

Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting
            multiplicity. (For example,

"a*a*b*c"

has degree 4.) We write the
            largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring
            the leading coefficient of the term.

The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk
            separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is
            still printed.

An example of a well formatted answer is

["-2*a*a*a", "3*a*a*b",
            "3*b*b", "4*a", "5*c", "-6"]

Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.  For example,
            an expression of "0" has an output of [].

Examples:

Input:

expression = "e + 8 - a + 5", evalvars = ["e"], evalints = [1]

Output:

["-1*a","14"]

Input:

expression = "e - 8 + temperature - pressure",
evalvars = ["e", "temperature"], evalints = [1, 12]

Output:

["-1*pressure","5"]

Input:

expression = "(e + 8) * (e - 8)", evalvars = [], evalints = []

Output:

["1*e*e","-64"]

Input:

expression = "7 - 7", evalvars = [], evalints = []

Output:

[]

Input:

expression = "a * b * c + b * a * c * 4", evalvars = [], evalints = []

Output:

["5*a*b*c"]

Input:

expression = "((a - b) * (b - c) + (c - a)) * ((a - b) + (b - c) * (c - a))",
evalvars = [], evalints = []

Output:

["-1*a*a*b*b","2*a*a*b*c","-1*a*a*c*c","1*a*b*b*b","-1*a*b*b*c","-1*a*b*c*c","1*a*c*c*c","-1*b*b*b*c","2*b*b*c*c","-1*b*c*c*c","2*a*a*b","-2*a*a*c","-2*a*b*b","2*a*c*c","1*b*b*b","-1*b*b*c","1*b*c*c","-1*c*c*c","-1*a*a","1*a*b","1*a*c","-1*b*c"]

will have length in range

## 0776-split-bst.md

# 776. Split BST

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/776.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/776.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Coupang, Google

## Description

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with root node

root

, and a target value

V

, split the tree into two subtrees where one subtree has nodes that are
        all smaller or equal to the target value, while the other subtree has all nodes that are
        greater than the target value.  It's not necessarily the case that the tree
        contains a node with value

V

.

Additionally, most of the structure of the original tree should remain.  Formally, for
        any child C with parent P in the original tree, if they are both in the same subtree after
        the split, then node C should still have the parent P.

You should output the root TreeNode of both subtrees after splitting, in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [4,2,6,1,3,5,7], V = 2

Output:

[[2,1],[4,3,6,null,null,5,7]]

Explanation:

Note that root, output[0], and output[1] are TreeNode objects, not arrays.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,5,7] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    / \
    1   3  5   7

while the diagrams for the outputs are:

        /   \
      3      6      and    2
            / \           /
           5   7         1

Note:

The size of the BST will not exceed

50

.

The BST is always valid and each node's value is different.

# 777. Swap Adjacent in LR String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/777.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/777.html)

**Companies:** ByteDance, Google

## Description

In a string composed of

'L'

,

'R'

, and

'X'

characters, like

"RXXLRXRXL"

, a move consists of either replacing one
        occurrence of

"XL"

with

"LX"

, or replacing one
        occurrence of

"RX"

with

"XR"

. Given the
        starting string

start

and the ending string

end

, return

True

if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to
        the other.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
Output:
True
Explanation:
We can transform start to end following these steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX
Note:
1 <= len(start) = len(end) <= 10000
.
Both start and end will only consist of characters in
{'L', 'R',
            'X'}
.

**Companies:** Facebook, Google

## Description

On an N x N

grid

, each square

grid[i][j]

represents the elevation
        at that point

(i,j)

.

Now rain starts to fall. At time

t

, the depth of the water everywhere is

t

. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and
        only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most

t

. You
        can swim infinite distance in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of
        the grid during your swim.

You start at the top left square

(0, 0)

. What is the least time until you can
        reach the bottom right square

(N-1, N-1)

?

Example 1:

Input:

[[0,2],[1,3]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

At time

0

, you are in grid location

(0, 0)

.
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You cannot reach point

(1, 1)

until time

3

.
When the depth of water is

3

, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

Example 2:

Input:

[[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]

11

17 18 19 20

10  9  8  7  6

The final route is marked in bold.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

Note:

# 781. Rabbits in Forest

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/781.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/781.html)

**Companies:** Wish

## Description

In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell
        you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those

answers

are
        placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

Examples:

Input:

answers = [1, 1, 2]

Output:

5

Explanation:

The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit than answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

Input:

answers = [10, 10, 10]

Output:

11

Input:

answers = []

Output:

0

Note:

answers

will have length at most

1000

.

Each

answers[i]

will be an integer in the range

[0, 999]

.

## 0782-transform-to-chessboard.md

# 782. Transform to Chessboard

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/782.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/782.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

An N x N

board

contains only

0

s and

1

s. In each move,
        you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard" - a
        board where no

0

s and no

1

s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the
        task is impossible, return -1.

Examples:

Input:

board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

One potential sequence of moves is shown below, from left to right:

0110     1010     1010
0110 --> 1010 --> 0101
1001     0101     1010
1001     0101     0101

The first move swaps the first and second column.
The second move swaps the second and third row.

Input:

board = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner,
01
10

is also a valid chessboard.

Input:

board = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.

Note:

board

will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range

[2, 30]

.

board[i][j]

will be only

0

s or

1

s.

## 0785-is-graph-bipartite.md

# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/785.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/785.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, LiveRamp, Microsoft

## Description

Given an undirected

graph

, return

true

if and only if it is
        bipartite.

Recall that a graph is

bipartite

if we can split it's set of nodes into two
        independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and
        another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form:

graph[i]

is a list of indexes

j

for which the edge between nodes

i

and

j

exists. 
        Each node is an integer between

0

and

graph.length - 1

. 
        There are no self edges or parallel edges:

graph[i]

does not contain

i

, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.

Example 2:

Input:

[[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.

Note:

graph

will have length in range

[1, 100]

.

graph[i]

will contain integers in range

[0, graph.length - 1]

.

graph[i]

will not contain

i

or duplicate values.

The graph is undirected: if any element

j

is in

graph[i]

, then

i

will be in

graph[j]

.

# 788. Rotated Digits

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/788.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/788.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, Google

## Description

X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid
        number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to
        leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to
        themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the
        numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number

N

, how many numbers X from

1

to

N

are good?

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
10
Output:
4
Explanation:
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
Note:
N  will be in range

## 0789-escape-the-ghosts.md

# 789. Escape The Ghosts

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/789.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/789.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are playing a simplified Pacman game. You start at the point

(0, 0)

,
        and your destination is

(target[0], target[1])

. There are several ghosts on the
        map, the i-th ghost starts at

(ghosts[i][0], ghosts[i][1])

.

Each turn, you and all ghosts simultaneously *may* move in one of 4 cardinal directions:
        north, east, west, or south, going from the previous point to a new point 1 unit of distance
        away.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you (for any
        given moves the ghosts may take.)  If you reach any square (including the target) at
        the same time as a ghost, it doesn't count as an escape.

Return True if and only if it is possible to escape.

Example 1:

Input:

ghosts = [[1, 0], [0, 3]]
target = [0, 1]

Output:

true

Explanation:

You can directly reach the destination (0, 1) at time 1, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) or (0, 3) have no way to catch up with you.

Example 2:

Input:

ghosts = [[1, 0]]
target = [2, 0]

Output:

false

Explanation:

You need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.

Example 3:

Input:

ghosts = [[2, 0]]
target = [1, 0]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.

Note:

All points have coordinates with absolute value <=

10000

.

The number of ghosts will not exceed

100

.

## Description

S

and

T

are strings composed of lowercase letters. In

S

, no letter occurs more than once.

S

was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters
        of

T

so that they match the order that

S

was sorted. More
        specifically, if

x

occurs before

y

in

S

, then

x

should occur before

y

in the returned string.

Return any permutation of

T

(as a string) that satisfies this property.

Example :

Input:

S = "cba"
T = "abcd"

Output:

"cbad"

Explanation:

"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

Note:

S

has length at most

26

, and no character is repeated in

S

.

T

has length at most

## 0794-valid-tic-tac-toe-state.md

# 794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/794.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/794.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo

## Description

A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array

board

. Return True if and only if
        it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The

board

is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters

"
        "

,

"X"

, and

"O"

.  The "
        " character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").

The first player always places "X" characters, while the second player always
            places "O" characters.

"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never
            filled ones.

The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row,
            column, or diagonal.

The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.

No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Example 1:

Input:

board = ["O  ", "   ", "   "]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The first player always plays "X".

Example 2:

Input:

board = ["XOX", " X ", "   "]

Output:

false

Explanation:

Players take turns making moves.

Example 3:

Input:

board = ["XXX", "   ", "OOO"]

Output:

false

Example 4:

Input:

board = ["XOX", "O O", "XOX"]

Output:

true

Note:

board

is a length-3 array of strings, where each string

board[i]

has length 3.

Each

board[i][j]

is a character in the set

{" ", "X",
            "O"}

## 0798-smallest-rotation-with-highest-score.md

# 798. Smallest Rotation with Highest Score

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/798.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/798.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given an array

A

, we may rotate it by a non-negative integer

K

so that the array becomes

A[K], A[K+1], A{K+2], ... A[A.length - 1],
            A[0], A[1], ..., A[K-1]

.  Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal
        to their index are worth 1 point.

For example, if we have

[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]

, and we rotate by

K = 2

, it
        becomes

[1, 3, 0, 2, 4]

.  This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no
        points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one
        point].

Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to the highest
        score we could receive.  If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index
        K.

Example 1:

Input:

[2, 3, 1, 4, 0]

Output:

3

Explanation:

Scores for each K are listed below:
K = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
K = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3
K = 2,  A = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3
K = 3,  A = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4
K = 4,  A = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3

So we should choose K = 3, which has the highest score.

Example 2:

Input:

[1, 3, 0, 2, 4]

Output:

0

Explanation:

A will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.
So we will choose the smallest K, which is 0.

Note:

A

will have length at most

20000

.

A[i]

will be in the range

[0, A.length]

.

## 0799-champagne-tower.md

# 799. Champagne Tower

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/799.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/799.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses,
        and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup (250ml) of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured in the first glass at the top.  When the top most glass
        is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and
        right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to
        the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has it's
        excess champagne fall on the floor.)

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After
        two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. 
        After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full
        glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the
        middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured
        below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the j-th glass
        in the i-th row is (both i and j are 0 indexed.)

Example 1:

Input:

poured = 1, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1

Output:

0.0

Explanation:

We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

Example 2:

Input:

poured = 2, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1

Output:

0.5

Explanation:

We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.

Note:

poured

will be in the range of

[0, 10 ^ 9]

.

query_glass

and

query_row

will be in the range of

[0,
            99]

## 0800-similar-rgb-color.md

# 800. Similar RGB Color

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/800.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/800.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

In the following, every capital letter represents some hexadecimal digit from

0

to

f

.

The red-green-blue color

"#AABBCC"

can be
        written as

"#ABC"

in shorthand.  For example,

"#15c"

is shorthand for the color

"#1155cc"

.

Now, say the similarity between two colors

"#ABCDEF"

and

"#UVWXYZ"

is

-(AB - UV)^2 - (CD - WX)^2 - (EF - YZ)^2

.

Given the color

"#ABCDEF"

, return a 7 character color that is
        most similar to

#ABCDEF

, and has a shorthand (that is, it can be represented as
        some

"#XYZ"

Example 1:

Input:

color = "#09f166"

Output:

"#11ee66"

Explanation:

The similarity is -(0x09 - 0x11)^2 -(0xf1 - 0xee)^2 - (0x66 - 0x66)^2 = -64 -9 -0 = -73.
This is the highest among any shorthand color.

Note:

color

is a string of length

7

.

color

is a valid RGB color: for

i > 0

,

color[i]

is a hexadecimal digit from

0

to

# 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/801.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/801.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google

## Description

We have two integer sequences

A

and

B

of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements

A[i]

and

B[i]

.  Note that both
        elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps,

A

and

B

are both strictly
        increasing.  (A sequence is

strictly increasing

if and only if

A[0] <
            A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1]

.)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing. 
        It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

# 802. Find Eventual Safe States

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/802.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/802.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the
        graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed
        edges), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is

eventually safe

if and only if we must eventually
        walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number

K

so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal
        node in less than

K

steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.

The directed graph has

N

nodes with labels

0, 1, ..., N-1

, where

N

is the length of

graph

.  The graph is given in the
        following form:

graph[i]

is a list of labels

j

such that

(i,
            j)

is a directed edge of the graph.

## Examples

### Example

Example:
Input:
graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output:
[2,4,5,6]
Here is a diagram of the above graph.
Note:
graph
will have length at most

## 0803-bricks-falling-when-hit.md

# 803. Bricks Falling When Hit

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/803.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/803.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We have a grid of 1s and 0s; the 1s in a cell represent bricks.  A brick will not drop
        if and only if it is directly connected to the top of the grid, or at least one of its
        (4-way) adjacent bricks will not drop.

We will do some erasures sequentially. Each time we want to do the erasure at the
        location (i, j), the brick (if it exists) on that location will disappear, and then some
        other bricks may drop because of that erasure.

Return an array representing the number of bricks that will drop after each erasure in
        sequence.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]]
hits = [[1,0]]

Output:

[2]

Explanation:

If we erase the brick at (1, 0), the brick at (1, 1) and (1, 2) will drop. So we should return 2.

Example 2:

Input:

grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]

Output:

[0,0]

Explanation:

When we erase the brick at (1, 0), the brick at (1, 1) has already disappeared due to the last move. So each erasure will cause no bricks dropping.  Note that the erased brick (1, 0) will not be counted as a dropped brick.

Note:

The number of rows and columns in the grid will be in the range [1, 200].

The number of erasures will not exceed the area of the grid.

It is guaranteed that each erasure will be different from any other erasure, and located
            inside the grid.

An erasure may refer to a location with no brick - if it does, no bricks drop.

## 0804-unique-morse-code-words.md

# 804. Unique Morse Code Words

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/804.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/804.html)

**Companies:** Apple, Google

## Description

International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series
        of dots and dashes, as follows:

"a"

maps to

".-"

,

"b"

maps to

"-..."

,

"c"

maps to

"-.-."

, and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given
        below:

[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]

Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of
        each letter. For example, "cba" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which
        is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call
        such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output:
2
Explanation:
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".
Note:
The length of
words
will be at most
100
.
Each
words[i]
will have length in range
[1, 12]
.
words[i]
will only consist of lowercase letters.

## 0806-number-of-lines-to-write-string.md

# 806. Number of Lines To Write String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/806.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/806.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We are to write the letters of a given string

S

, from left to right into lines.
        Each line has maximum width 100 units, and if writing a letter would cause the width of the
        line to exceed 100 units, it is written on the next line. We are given an array

widths

,
        an array where widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b',
        ..., and widths[25] is the width of 'z'.

Now answer two questions: how many lines have at least one character from

S

, and
        what is the width used by the last such line? Return your answer as an integer list of
        length 2.

Example :

Input:

widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

Output:

[3, 60]

Explanation:

All letters have the same length of 10. To write all 26 letters,
we need two full lines and one line with 60 units.

Example :

Input:

widths = [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "bbbcccdddaaa"

Output:

[2, 4]

Explanation:

All letters except 'a' have the same length of 10, and
"bbbcccdddaa" will cover 9 * 10 + 2 * 4 = 98 units.
For the last 'a', it is written on the second line because
there is only 2 units left in the first line.
So the answer is 2 lines, plus 4 units in the second line.

Note:

The length of

S

will be in the range [1, 1000].

S

will only contain lowercase letters.

widths

is an array of length

26

.

widths[i]

# 807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/807.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/807.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

In a 2 dimensional array

grid

, each value

grid[i][j]

represents the
        height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of
        buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0
        is considered to be a building as well.

At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid,
        i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the
        original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the
        buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output:
35
Explanation:
The grid is:
[ [3, 0, 8, 4],
  [2, 4, 5, 7],
  [9, 2, 6, 3],
  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]

The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]

The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:

gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
            [7, 4, 7, 7],
            [9, 4, 8, 7],
            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]
Notes:
1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50
.
All heights
grid[i][j]
are in the range
[0, 100]
.
All buildings in
grid[i][j]
occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are
            a
1 x 1 x grid[i][j]
rectangular prism.

## 0808-soup-servings.md

# 808. Soup Servings

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/808.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/808.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially we have

N

ml of each
        type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:

Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B

Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B

Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B

Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B

When we serve some soup, we give it to someone and we no longer have it.  Each turn, we
        will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of
        soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as we can.  We
        stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

Note that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.

Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A
        and B become empty at the same time.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
N = 50
Output:
0.625
Explanation:
If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.
Notes:
0 <= N <= 10^9
.
Answers within
10^-6
of the true value will be accepted as
            correct.

        of characters

c

to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more.

For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o"
        to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo"
        has size less than 3.  Also, we could do another extension like "ll" ->
        "lllll" to get "helllllooo".  If

S =
            "helllllooo"

, then the query word "hello" would be stretchy
        because of these two extension operations:

query = "hello" -> "hellooo"
            -> "helllllooo" = S

.

Given a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
S = "heeellooo"
words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output:
1
Explanation:
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.
Notes:
0 <= len(S) <= 100
.
0 <= len(words) <= 100
.
0 <= len(words[i]) <= 100

## 0810-chalkboard-xor-game.md

# 810. Chalkboard XOR Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/810.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/810.html)

**Companies:** Garena

## Description

We are given non-negative integers nums[i] which are written on a chalkboard.  Alice and
        Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. 
        If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to
        become 0, then that player loses.  (Also, we'll say the bitwise XOR of one
        element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.)

Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the
        chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output:
false
Explanation:
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2.
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose.
If Alice erases 2 first, now nums becomes [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.
Notes:
1 <= N <= 1000
.
0 <= nums[i] <= 2^16
.

## 0811-subdomain-visit-count.md

# 811. Subdomain Visit Count

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/811.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/811.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Citrix, Google, Indeed, Intuit, Karat, Pinterest, Roblox, Wayfair

## Description

A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the
        top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com", and
        at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like "discuss.leetcode.com",
        we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com"
        implicitly.

Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number of visits
        this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a
        count-paired domain might be "9001 discuss.leetcode.com".

We are given a list

cpdomains

of count-paired domains. We would like a list of
        count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly
        counts the number of visits to each subdomain.

Example 1:

Input:

["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]

Output:

["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]

Explanation:

We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com". As discussed above, the subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.

Example 2:

Input:

["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]

Output:

["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 intel.mail.com","951 com"]

Explanation:

We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times, "intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times. For the subdomains, we will visit "mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5 times.

Notes:

The length of

cpdomains

will not exceed

100

.

The length of each domain name will not exceed

100

.

Each address will have either 1 or 2 "." characters.

The input count in any count-paired domain will not exceed

10000

.

The answer output can be returned in any order.

# 812. Largest Triangle Area

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/812.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/812.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be
        formed by any 3 of the points.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:

Output:
2
Explanation:
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.

**Companies:** Baidu, Google

## Description

We partition a row of numbers

A

into at most

K

adjacent
        (non-empty) groups, then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the
        largest score we can achieve?

Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily
        integers.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
A = [9,1,2,3,9]
K = 3
Output:
20
Explanation:
The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.
That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 100
.
1 <= A[i] <= 10000
.
1 <= K <= A.length
.
Answers within
10^-6
of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.

# 815. Bus Routes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/815.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/815.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Uber

## Description

We have a list of bus routes. Each

routes[i]

is a bus route that the i-th bus repeats
        forever. For example if

routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]

, this means that the first bus
        (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->...
        forever.

We start at bus stop

S

(initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus stop

T

. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to
        reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
S = 1
T = 6
Output:

## 0816-ambiguous-coordinates.md

# 816. Ambiguous Coordinates

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/816.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/816.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like

"(1, 3)"

or

"(2,
        0.5)"

.  Then, we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces, and
        ended up with the string

S

.  Return a list of strings representing all
        possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.

Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers
        like "00", "0.0", "0.00", "1.0", "001",
        "00.01", or any other number that can be represented with less digits. 
        Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring
        before it, so we never started with numbers like ".1".

The final answer list can be returned in any order.  Also note that all coordinates in
        the final answer have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)

Example 1:

Input:

"(123)"

Output:

["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]

Example 2:

Input:

"(00011)"

Output:

["(0.001, 1)", "(0, 0.011)"]

Explanation:

0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.

Example 3:

Input:

"(0123)"

Output:

["(0, 123)", "(0, 12.3)", "(0, 1.23)", "(0.1, 23)", "(0.1, 2.3)", "(0.12, 3)"]

Example 4:

Input:

"(100)"

Output:

[(10, 0)]

Explanation:

1.0 is not allowed.

Note:

4 <= S.length <= 12

# 818. Race Car

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/818.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/818.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.  (Your car can go
        into negative positions.)

Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R
        (reverse).

When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following:

position
        += speed, speed *= 2

.

When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is
        positive then

speed = -1

, otherwise

speed = 1

. 
        (Your position stays the same.)

For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3,
        and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.

Now for some target position, say the

length

of the shortest sequence of
        instructions to get there.

Example 1:

Input:

target = 3

Output:

2

Explanation:

The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3.

Example 2:

Input:

target = 6

Output:

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle

## Description

Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not
        in the list of banned words.  It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't
        banned, and that the answer is unique.

Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation. 
        Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive.  The answer is in lowercase.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output:
"ball"
Explanation:
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph.
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"),
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
Note:
1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000
.
0 <= banned.length <= 100
.
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10
.
The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in
paragraph
may
            have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
paragraph
only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols
!?',;.
There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

## 0822-card-flipping-game.md

# 822. Card Flipping Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/822.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/822.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

On a table are

N

cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of
        each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card.

If the number

X

on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any
        card, then this number X is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output

0

.

Here,

fronts[i]

and

backs[i]

represent the number on the front and
        back of card

i

.

A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back
        and vice versa.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
Output:
2
Explanation:
If we flip the second card, the fronts are
[1,3,4,4,7]
and the backs are
[1,2,4,1,3]
.
We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on the front of any card, so
2
is good.
Note:

## 0824-goat-latin.md

# 824. Goat Latin

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/824.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/824.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

A sentence

S

is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists
        of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "

Goat Latin"

(a made-up
        language similar to Pig Latin.)

The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append

"ma"

to
            the end of the word.

For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.

If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append
            it to the end, then add

"ma"

.

For example, the word

"goat"

becomes

"oatgma"

.

Add one letter

'a'

to the end of each word per its word index
            in the sentence, starting with 1.

For example, the first word gets

"a"

added to the end, the
            second word gets

"aa"

added to the end and so on.

Return the final sentence representing the conversion from

S

to Goat Latin.

Example 1:

Input:

"I speak Goat Latin"

Output:

"Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"

Example 2:

Input:

"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

Output:

"heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"

Notes:

S

contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces. Exactly one space

# 826. Most Profit Assigning Work

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/826.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/826.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, NetEase, Nutanix, Uber

## Description

We have jobs:

difficulty[i]

is the difficulty of the

i

th
        job, and

profit[i]

is the profit of the

i

th job.

Now we have some workers.

worker[i]

is the ability of
        the

i

th worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with
        difficulty at most

worker[i]

.

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple
        times.

For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. 
        If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.

What is the most profit we can make?

Example 1:

Input:

difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]

Output:

100

Explanation: W

orkers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.

Notes:

1 <= difficulty.length = profit.length <= 10000

## 0828-unique-letter-string.md

# 828. Unique Letter String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/828.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/828.html)

**Companies:** ForUsAll, Twitch

## Description

A character is unique in string

S

if it occurs exactly once in it.

For example, in string

S = "LETTER"

, the only unique characters are

"L"

and

"R"

.

Let's define

UNIQ(S)

as the number of unique characters in string

S

.

For example,

UNIQ("LETTER") =  2

.

Given a string

S

with only uppercases, calculate the sum of

UNIQ(substring)

over all non-empty substrings of

S

.

If there are two or more equal substrings at different positions in

S

, we
        consider them different.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo

10 ^ 9 +
        7

.

Example 1:

Input:

"ABC"

Output:

10

Explanation:

All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".
Evey substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10

Example 2:

Input:

"ABA"

Output:

8

Explanation:

The same as example 1, except uni("ABA") = 1.

## 0830-positions-of-large-groups.md

# 830. Positions of Large Groups

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/830.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/830.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

In a string

S

of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive
        groups of the same character.

For example, a string like

S = "abbxxxxzyy"

has the groups

"a"

,

"bb"

,

"xxxx"

,

"z"

and

"yy"

.

Call a group

large

if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting
        and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

## 0831-masking-personal-information.md

# 831. Masking Personal Information

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/831.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/831.html)

**Companies:** Twitter

## Description

We are given a personal information string

S

, which may represent either

an email address

or

a phone number.

We would like to mask this personal information according to the following
        rules:

1. Email address:

We define a

name

to be a string of

length ≥ 2

consisting of only lowercase letters

a-z

or uppercase letters

A-Z

.

An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol

'@'

,
        followed by a name, followed by the dot

'.'

and followed
        by a name.

All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of

"name1@name2.name3".

To mask an email,

all names must be converted to lowercase

and

all
        letters between the first and last letter of the first name

must be replaced by 5
        asterisks

'*'

.

2. Phone number:

A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits

0-9

or the
        characters from the set

{'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}.

You
        may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.

The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the
        country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4
        digits and mask all other digits.

The local number should be formatted and masked as

"***-***-1111",

where

1

represents the exposed digits.

To mask a phone number with country code like

"+111 111 111 1111"

, we
        write it in the form

"+***-***-***-1111".

The

'+'

sign and the first

'-'

sign before
        the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit
        phone number mask should start with

"+**-"

.

Note that extraneous characters like

"(", ")", " "

,
        as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be
        removed.

Return the correct "mask" of the information provided.

Example 1:

Input:

"LeetCode@LeetCode.com"

Output:

"l*****e@leetcode.com"

Explanation:

All names are converted to lowercase, and the letters between the
             first and last letter of the first name is replaced by 5 asterisks.
             Therefore, "leetcode" -> "l*****e".

Example 2:

Input:

"AB@qq.com"

Output:

"a*****b@qq.com"

Explanation:

There must be 5 asterisks between the first and last letter
             of the first name "ab". Therefore, "ab" -> "a*****b".

Example 3:

Input:

"1(234)567-890"

Output:

"***-***-7890"

Explanation:

10 digits in the phone number, which means all digits make up the local number.

Example 4:

Input:

"86-(10)12345678"

Output:

"+**-***-***-5678"

Explanation:

12 digits, 2 digits for country code and 10 digits for local number.

Notes:

S.length <= 40

.

Emails have length at least 8.

Phone numbers have length at least 10.

## 0832-flipping-an.md

# 832. Flipping an Image

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/832.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/832.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a binary matrix

A

, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it,
        and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For
        example, flipping

[1, 1, 0]

horizontally results in

[0, 1,
            1]

.

To invert an image means that each

0

is replaced by

1

, and
        each

1

is replaced by

0

. For example, inverting

[0,
            1, 1]

results in

[1, 0, 0]

.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]

Output:

[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

Explanation:

First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

Example 2:

Input:

[[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]

Output:

[[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]

Explanation:

First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]

## 0833-find-and-replace-in-string.md

# 833. Find And Replace in String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/833.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/833.html)

**Companies:** Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft

## Description

To some string

S

, we will perform some replacement operations that
        replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).

Each replacement operation has

3

parameters: a starting index

i

, a
        source word

x

and a target word

y

.  The rule
        is that if

x

starts at position

i

in the

original

string

S

, then we will replace that occurrence of

x

with

y

. 
        If not, we do nothing.

For example, if we have

S = "abcd"

and we have some
        replacement operation

i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff"

,
        then because

"cd"

starts at position

2

in the original string

S

, we will
        replace it with

"ffff"

.

Using another example on

S = "abcd"

, if we have both the replacement
        operation

i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee"

, as well as another
        replacement operation

i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff"

,
        this second operation does nothing because in the original string

S[2] = 'c'

,
        which doesn't match

x[0] = 'e'

.

All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be
        any overlap in replacement: for example,

S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources
            = ["ab","bc"]

is not a valid test case.

Example 1:

Input:

S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["a","cd"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]

Output:

"eeebffff"

Explanation:

"a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
"cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".

Example 2:

Input:

S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]

Output:

"eeecd"

Explanation:

"ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
"ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the

original

S, so we do nothing.

Notes:

0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <=
            100

0 < indexes[i] < S.length <= 1000

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/835.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/835.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Two images

A

and

B

are given, represented as binary, square
        matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)

We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of
        units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the

overlap

of this
        translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

(Note also that a translation does

not

include any kind of rotation.)

What is the largest possible overlap?

Example 1:

Input:

A = [[1,1,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,1,0]]
       B = [[0,0,0],
            [0,1,1],

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/837.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/837.html)

**Companies:** Google, Uber

## Description

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with

0

points, and draws numbers while she has less than

K

points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points
        randomly from the range

[1, W]

, where

W

is an integer.  Each
        draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets

K

or more points.  What is the
        probability that she has

N

or less points?

Example 1:

Input:

N = 10, K = 1, W = 10

Output:

1.00000

Explanation:

Alice gets a single card, then stops.

Example 2:

Input:

N = 6, K = 1, W = 10

Output:

0.60000

Explanation:

Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.

Example 3:

Input:

N = 21, K = 17, W = 10

Output:

0.73278

Note:

0 <= K <= N <= 10000

1 <= W <= 10000

# 838. Push Dominoes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/838.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/838.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There are

N

dominoes in a line, and we place
        each domino vertically upright.

In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to
        the right.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the
        left.

Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the
        right.

When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the
        balance of the forces.

For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no
        additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

Given a string "S" representing the initial state.

S[i] =
        'L'

, if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;

S[i] =
        'R'

, if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right;

S[i] = '.'

, if
        the

i

-th domino has not been pushed.

Return a string representing the final state.

Example 1:

Input:

".L.R...LR..L.."

Output:

"LL.RR.LLRRLL.."

Example 2:

Input:

"RR.L"

Output:

"RR.L"

Explanation:

The first domino expends no additional force on the second domino.

Note:

0 <= N <= 10^5

String

dominoes

contains only

'L

',

'R'

and

'.'

# 839. Similar String Groups

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/839.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/839.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, Google, Snapchat

## Description

Two strings

X

and

Y

are similar if we can swap two
        letters (in different positions) of

X

, so that it equals

Y

.

For example,

"tars"

and

"rats"

are
        similar (swapping at positions

0

and

2

), and

"rats"

and

"arts"

are similar, but

"star"

is not
        similar to

"tars"

,

"rats"

, or

"arts"

.

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity:

{"tars", "rats",
        "arts"}

and

{"star"}

.  Notice that

"tars"

and

"arts"

are in the same group even though they are not similar. 
        Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at
        least one other word in the group.

We are given a list

A

of strings.  Every string in

A

is an
        anagram of every other string in

A

.  How many groups are there?

Example 1:

Input:

["tars","rats","arts","star"]

Output:

2

Note:

A.length <= 2000

A[i].length <= 1000

A.length * A[i].length <= 20000

All words in

A

consist of lowercase letters only.

All words in

A

have the same length and are anagrams of each other.

The judging time limit has been increased for this question.

## 0841-keys-and-rooms.md

# 841. Keys and Rooms

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/841.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/841.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

There are

N

rooms and you start in room

0

.  Each room has a
        distinct number in

0, 1, 2, ..., N-1

, and each room may have some keys to
        access the next room.

Formally, each room

i

has a list of keys

rooms[i]

, and each
        key

rooms[i][j]

is an integer in

[0, 1, ..., N-1]

where

N =
            rooms.length

.  A key

rooms[i][j] = v

opens the room with
        number

v

.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room

0

).

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return

true

if and only if you can enter every room.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1],[2],[3],[]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

We start in room 0, and pick up key 1.
We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.
We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.
We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.

Example 2:

Input:

[[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

We can't enter the room with number 2.

Note:

1 <= rooms.length <= 1000

0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000

The number of keys in all rooms combined is at most

3000

## 0842-split-array-into-fibonacci-sequence.md

# 842. Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/842.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/842.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Given a string

S

of digits, such as

S = "123456579"

,
        we can split it into a

Fibonacci-like sequence

[123, 456, 579].

Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list

F

of non-negative integers
        such that:

0 <= F[i] <= 2^31 - 1

, (that is, each integer fits a 32-bit
            signed integer type);

F.length >= 3

;

and

F[i] + F[i+1] = F[i+2]

for all

0 <= i < F.length - 2

.

Also, note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading
        zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.

Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from

S

, or return

[]

if it
        cannot be done.

Example 1:

Input:

"123456579"

Output:

[123,456,579]

Example 2:

Input:

"11235813"

Output:

[1,1,2,3,5,8,13]

Example 3:

Input:

"112358130"

Output:

[]

Explanation:

The task is impossible.

Example 4:

Input:

"0123"

Output:

[]

Explanation:

Leading zeroes are not allowed, so "01", "2", "3" is not valid.

Example 5:

Input:

"1101111"

Output:

[110, 1, 111]

Explanation:

The output [11, 0, 11, 11] would also be accepted.

## 0843-guess-the-word.md

# 843. Guess the Word

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/843.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/843.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft

## Description

This problem is an

interactive problem

new to the
        LeetCode platform.

We are given a word list of unique words, each word is 6 letters long, and one word in this
        list is chosen as

secret

.

You may call

master.guess(word)

to guess a word.  The guessed word
        should have type

string

and must be from the original list with
        6 lowercase letters.

This function returns an

integer

type, representing the number of
        exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the

secret word

. 
        Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return

-1

instead.

For each test case, you have 10 guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls,
        if you have made 10 or less calls to

master.guess

and at least one of
        these guesses was the

secret

, you pass the testcase.

Besides the example test case below, there will be 5 additional test cases, each with
        100 words in the word list.  The letters of each word in those testcases were chosen independently
        at random from

'a'

to

'z'

, such that every word in
        the given word lists is unique.

Example 1:

Input:

secret = "acckzz", wordlist = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"]

Explanation:

master.guess("aaaaaa")

returns -1, because

"aaaaaa"

is not in wordlist.

master.guess("acckzz")

returns 6, because

"acckzz"

is secret and has all 6 matches.

master.guess("ccbazz")

returns 3, because

"ccbazz"

has 3 matches.

master.guess("eiowzz")

returns 2, because

"eiowzz"

has 2 matches.

master.guess("abcczz")

returns 4, because

"abcczz"

has 4 matches.

We made 5 calls to master.guess and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.

Note:

Any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will
        result in disqualification.

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

In a row of

seats

,

1

represents a person sitting in that seat, and

0

represents that the seat is empty.

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to
        him is maximized.

Return that maximum distance to closest person.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,0,0,0,1,0,1]

Output:

2

Explanation:

If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,0,0,0]

Output:

3

Explanation:

If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.

Note:

1 <= seats.length <= 20000

seats

contains only 0s or 1s, at least one

0

i

th
        rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all

rectangles

in the plane.  Since the
        answer may be too large,

return it modulo 10^9 + 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

[[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]

Output:

6

Explanation:

As illustrated in the picture.

Example 2:

Input:

[[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]

Output:

49

Explanation:

The answer is 10^18 modulo (10^9 + 7), which is (10^9)^2 = (-7)^2 = 49.

Note:

1 <= rectangles.length <= 200

rectanges[i].length = 4

0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 10^9

), each person has different
        amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.

For convenience, we'll call the person with label

x

, simply "person

x

".

We'll say that

richer[i] = [x, y]

if person

x

definitely
        has more money than person

y

.  Note that

richer

may
        only be a subset of valid observations.

Also, we'll say

quiet[x] = q

if person

x

has
        quietness

q

.

Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.

answer[7] = 7.
Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
(which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x])
is person 7.

The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.

## 0853-car-fleet.md

# 853. Car Fleet

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/853.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/853.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

N

cars are going to the same destination along a one lane road.  The
        destination is

target

miles away.

Each car

i

has a constant speed

speed[i]

(in miles per
        hour), and initial position

position[i]

miles towards the target along the
        road.

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it, and drive bumper to
        bumper at the same speed.

The distance between these two cars is ignored - they are assumed to have the same
        position.

A

car fleet

is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same
        speed.  Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered
        as one car fleet.

How many car fleets will arrive at the destination?

Example 1:

Input:

target =

12

, position =

[10,8,0,5,3]

, speed =

[2,4,1,1,3]

Output:

3

Explanation

:
The cars starting at 10 and 8 become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 doesn't catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 and 3 become a fleet, meeting each other at 6.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.

Note:

0 <= N <= 10 ^ 4

0 < target <= 10 ^ 6

0 < speed[i] <= 10 ^ 6

0 <= position[i] < target

All initial positions are different.

## 0855-exam-room.md

# 855. Exam Room

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/855.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/855.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Google, Quip (Salesforce), Quora, Uber

## Description

In an exam room, there are

N

seats in a single row, numbered

0, 1, 2, ...,
        N-1

.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the
        closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest
        number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)

Return a class

ExamRoom(int N)

that exposes two functions:

ExamRoom.seat()

returning
        an

int

representing what seat the student sat in, and

ExamRoom.leave(int
            p)

representing that the student in seat number

p

now
        leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to

ExamRoom.leave(p)

have a student sitting in seat

p

.

Example 1:

Input:

["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"]

,

[[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]

Output:

[null,0,9,4,2,null,5]

Explanation

:
ExamRoom(10) -> null
seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
leave(4) -> null
seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.

âââââââ

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^9

ExamRoom.seat()

and

ExamRoom.leave()

will be called at most

10^4

times across all test cases.

Calls to

ExamRoom.leave(p)

are guaranteed to have a student currently
            sitting in seat number

p

.

## 0860-lemonade-change.md

# 860. Lemonade Change

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/860.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/860.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Atlassian

## Description

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs

$5

.

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order
        specified by

bills

).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a

$5

,

$10

,
        or

$20

bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so
        that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return

true

if and only if you can provide every customer with correct
        change.

Example 1:

Input:

[5,5,5,10,20]

Output:

true

Explanation:

From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

Example 2:

Input:

[5,5,10]

Output:

true

Example 3:

Input:

[10,10]

Output:

false

Example 4:

Input:

[5,5,10,10,20]

Output:

false

Explanation:

From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.

Note:

0 <= bills.length <= 10000

bills[i]

will be either

5

,

10

, or

20

.

## Description

We are given a 2-dimensional

"#"

is a wall,

"@"

is the
        starting point, (

"a"

,

, ...) are keys, and
        (

"A"

,

"B"

, ...) are locks.

We start at the starting point, and one move consists of walking one space in one of the 4
        cardinal directions.  We cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.  If we
        walk over a key, we pick it up.  We can't walk over a lock unless we have the
        corresponding key.

For some

1 <= K <= 6

, there is exactly one lowercase and
        one uppercase letter of the first

        grid.  This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each
        key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the
        same order as the English alphabet.

Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys.  If it's impossible,

## 0871-minimum-number-of-refueling-stops.md

# 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/871.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/871.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Baidu, Google, Microsoft

## Description

A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is

target

miles
        east of the starting position.

Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each

station[i]

represents a
        gas station that is

station[i][0]

miles east of the starting position, and has

station[i][1]

liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has

startFuel

liters
        of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas
        from the station into the car.

What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its
        destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return

-1

.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. 
        If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have
        arrived.

Example 1:

Input:

target =

1

, startFuel =

1

, stations =

[]

Output:

0

Explanation:

We can reach the target without refueling.

Example 2:

Input:

target =

100

, startFuel =

1

, stations =

[[10,100]]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).

Example 3:

Input:

target =

100

, startFuel =

10

, stations =

[[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.

Note:

1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9

0 <= stations.length <= 500

0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... <
                        stations[stations.length-1][0] < target

## 0877-stone-game.md

# 877. Stone Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/877.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/877.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Google

## Description

Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles

arranged in a row

, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones

piles[i]

.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of
        stones is odd, so there are no ties.

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the
        entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues
        until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return

True

if and only if Alex wins
        the game.

Example 1:

Input:

[5,3,4,5]

Output:

true

Explanation:

Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.

Note:

2 <= piles.length <= 500

piles.length

is even.

1 <= piles[i] <= 500

sum(piles)

is odd.

Let's call a

profitable scheme

any subset of these crimes that
        generates at least

P

profit, and the total number of gang members participating
        in that subset of crimes is at most G.

How many schemes can be chosen?  Since the answer may be very large,

The graph is given as follows:

edges[k]

is a list of integer pairs

(i, j,
        n)

such that

(i, j)

is an edge of the original graph,

and

n

is the total number of

new

nodes on that edge.

Then, the edge

(i, j)

is deleted from the original graph,

n

new
        nodes

(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)

are added to the original graph,

and

n+1

new edges

(i, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{n-1},
        x_n), (x_n, j)

# 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/883.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/883.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

On a

N * N

grid, we place some

1 * 1 * 1

cubes
        that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value

v = grid[i][j]

represents a tower of

v

cubes
        placed on top of grid cell

(i, j)

.

Now we view the

projection

of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx
        planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional
        plane.

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the
        front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/885.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/885.html)

**Companies:** Dataminr, Facebook

## Description

On a 2 dimensional grid with

R

rows and

C

columns, we start at

(r0, c0)

facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the
        south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid.

Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the
        grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.)

Eventually, we reach all

R * C

spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were
        visited.

Example 1:

Input:

R =

1

, C =

# 887. Super Egg Drop

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/887.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/887.html)

**Companies:** Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft

## Description

You are given

K

eggs, and you have access to a building with

N

floors from

1

to

N

.

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.

You know that there exists a floor

F

with

0 <= F <= N

such
        that any egg dropped at a floor higher than

F

will break, and any egg dropped
        at or below floor

F

will not break.

Each

move

, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any
        floor

X

(with

1 <= X <= N

).

Your goal is to know

with certainty

what the value of

F

is.

What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what

F

is, regardless of the initial value of

F

?

Example 1:

Input:

K =

1

, N =

2

Output:

2

Explanation:

Drop the egg from floor 1.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 1.
If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.
Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with certainty.

Example 2:

Input:

K =

2

, N = 6

Output:

3

Example 3:

Input:

K =

3

, N =

14

Output:

# 890. Find and Replace Pattern

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/890.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/890.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Google

## Description

You have a list of

words

and a

pattern

, and you want to know
        which words in

words

matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters

p

so that
        after replacing every letter

x

in the pattern with

p(x)

, we get
        the desired word.

(

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every
        letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

)

Return a list of the words in

words

that match the given pattern.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

words =

["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"]

, pattern =

"abb"

Output:

["mee","aqq"]

Explanation:

"mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}.
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.

# 895. Maximum Frequency Stack

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/895.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/895.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Google, Salesforce, Uber

## Description

Implement

FreqStack

, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data
        structure.

FreqStack

has two functions:

push(int x)

, which pushes an integer

x

onto the stack.

pop()

, which

removes

and returns the most frequent element
            in the stack.

If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of
                    the stack is removed and returned.

Example 1:

Input:

["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"]

,

[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]

Output:

[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]

Explanation

:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].

Note:

Calls to

FreqStack.push(int x)

will be such that

0 <= x <=
            10^9

.

It is guaranteed that

FreqStack.pop()

won't be called if the stack has
            zero elements.

The total number of

FreqStack.push

calls will not exceed

10000

in a single test case.

The total number of

FreqStack.pop

calls will not exceed

10000

in a single test case.

The total number of

FreqStack.push

# 898. Bitwise ORs of Subarrays

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/898.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/898.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

We have an array

A

of non-negative integers.

For every (contiguous) subarray

B = [A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[j]]

(with

i
        <= j

), we take the bitwise OR of all the elements in

B

, obtaining a
        result

A[i] | A[i+1] | ... | A[j]

.

Return the number of possible results.  (Results that occur more than once are only
        counted once in the final answer.)

Example 1:

Input:

[0]

Output:

1

Explanation:

There is only one possible result: 0.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,1,2]

Output:

3

Explanation:

The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2].
These yield the results 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3.
There are 3 unique values, so the answer is 3.

Example 3:

Input:

[1,2,4]

Output:

6

Explanation:

The possible results are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.

## Description

A string

S

of lowercase letters is given.  Then, we may make any number of

moves

.

In each move, we choose one of the first

K

letters (starting from the
        left), remove it, and place it at the end of the string.

Return the lexicographically smallest string we could have after any number of moves.

Example 1:

Input:

S =

"cba"

, K =

1

Output:

"acb"

Explanation:

In the first move, we move the 1st character ("c") to the end, obtaining the string "bac".
In the second move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the final result "acb".

Example 2:

S =

"baaca"

, K =

3

Output:

"aaabc"

Explanation:

In the first move, we move the 1st character ("b") to the end, obtaining the string "aacab".
In the second move, we move the 3rd character ("c") to the end, obtaining the final result "aaabc".

Note:

## 0900-rle-iterator.md

# 900. RLE Iterator

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/900.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/900.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Wish

## Description

Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by

RLEIterator(int[] A)

, where

A

is a
        run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even

i

,

A[i]

tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value

A[i+1]

is
        repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function:

next(int n)

, which exhausts the next

n

elements (

n >= 1

) and returns the last element exhausted
        in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust,

next

returns

-1

instead.

For example, we start with

A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]

, which is a run-length encoding of
        the sequence

[8,8,8,5,5]

.  This is because the sequence can be read as "three
        eights, zero nines, two fives".

Example 1:

Input:

["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"]

,

[[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]

Output:

[null,8,8,5,-1]

Explanation:

RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 1000

A.length

is an even integer.

0 <= A[i] <= 10^9

There are at most

1000

calls to

RLEIterator.next(int n)

per
            test case.

Each call to

RLEIterator.next(int n)

will have

1 <= n
            <= 10^9

.

## 0901-online-stock-span.md

# 901. Online Stock Span

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/901.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/901.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Write a class

StockSpanner

which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and
        returns the

span

of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive
        days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was
        less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were

[100, 80, 60, 70, 60,
        75, 85]

, then the stock spans would be

[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

.

Example 1:

Input:

["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"]

,

[[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]

Output:

[null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]

Explanation:

First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.

Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.

Note:

Calls to

StockSpanner.next(int price)

will have

1 <= price
                <= 10^5

.

There will be at most

10000

calls to

StockSpanner.next

per
                test case.

There will be at most

150000

calls to

StockSpanner.next

across all test cases.

The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and
                50% for all other languages.

## 0909-snakes-and-ladders.md

# 909. Snakes and Ladders

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/909.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/909.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, Uber

## Description

On an N x N

board

, the numbers from

1

to

N*N

are
        written

boustrophedonically

starting from the bottom left of
            the board

, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6
        board, the numbers are written as follows:

You start on square

1

of the board (which is always in the last row and first
        column).  Each move, starting from square

x

, consists of the following:

You choose a destination square

S

with number

x+1

,

x+2

,

x+3

,

x+4

,

x+5

, or

x+6

, provided this number
            is

<= N*N

.

(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are
                    always

at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the
                        board

.)

If

S

has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake
            or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to

S

.

A board square on row

r

and column

c

has a "snake or
        ladder" if

board[r][c] != -1

.  The destination of that snake or
        ladder is

board[r][c]

.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a
        snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do

not

continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first
        move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because
        you do

not

continue moving to `4`.)

Return the least number of moves required to reach square

N*N

. 
        If it is not possible, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

[
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]

Output:

4

Explanation:

At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].
You decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
It can be shown that you need at least 4 moves to reach the N*N-th square, so the answer is 4.

Note:

2 <= board.length = board[0].length <= 20

board[i][j]

is between

1

and

N*N

or is equal
            to

-1

.

The board square with number

1

has no snake or ladder.

The board square with number

N*N

has no snake or ladder.

## 0911-online-election.md

# 911. Online Election

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/911.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/911.html)

**Companies:** Apple, Google

## Description

In an election, the

i

-th vote was cast for

persons[i]

at time

times[i]

.

Now, we would like to implement the following query function:

TopVotedCandidate.q(int
        t)

will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time

t

.

Votes cast at time

t

will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie,
        the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Example 1:

Input:

["TopVotedCandidate","q","q","q","q","q","q"]

,

[[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]

Output:

[null,0,1,1,0,0,1]

Explanation:

At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.

Note:

1 <= persons.length = times.length <= 5000

0 <= persons[i] <= persons.length

times

is a strictly increasing array with all elements in

[0,
                10^9]

.

TopVotedCandidate.q

is called at most

10000

times per test
                case.

TopVotedCandidate.q(int t)

is always called with

t >=
                times[0]

.

## 0913-cat-and-mouse.md

# 913. Cat and Mouse

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/913.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/913.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

A game on an

undirected

graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who
        alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows:

graph[a]

is a list of all nodes

b

such that

ab

is an edge of the graph.

Mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, Cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a
        Hole at node 0.

During each player's turn, they

must

travel along one edge of the
        graph that meets where they are.  For example, if the Mouse is at node

1

,
        it

must

travel to any node in

graph[1]

.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)

Then, the game can end in 3 ways:

If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.

If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.

If ever a position is repeated (ie. the players are in the same position as a
            previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a

graph

, and assuming both players play optimally, return

1

if
        the game is won by Mouse,

2

if the game is won by Cat, and

0

if
        the game is a draw.

Example 1:

Input:

[[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

4---3---1
|   |
2---5
 \ /
  0

Note:

3 <= graph.length <= 50

It is guaranteed that

graph[1]

is non-empty.

It is guaranteed that

graph[2]

contains a non-zero element.

        string of lowercase letters.

Now, say that word

b

is a subset of word

a

if every letter in

b

occurs in

a

,

including multiplicity

.  For example,

"wrr"

is a subset of

"warrior"

, but is not a subset of

"world"

.

Now say a word

a

from

A

is

universal

if for every

b

in

B

,

b

is a subset of

a

.

Return a list of all universal words in

A

j

if and only if

graph[i][j] = 1

.

Some nodes

initial

are initially infected by malware.  Whenever two nodes

        nodes will be infected by malware.  This spread of malware will continue until no more
        nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose

M(initial)

is the final number of nodes infected with malware in
        the entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove one node from the initial list.  Return the node that if removed,
        would minimize

M(initial)

.  If multiple nodes could be removed to
        minimize

M(initial)

, return such a node with the smallest index.

Note that if a node was removed from the

initial

list of infected nodes, it
        may still be infected later as a result of the malware spread.

Example 1:

Input:

graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]

# 926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/926.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/926.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

A string of

'0'

s and

'1'

s is

monotone
        increasing

if it consists of some number of

'0'

s (possibly 0),
        followed by some number of

'1'

s (also possibly 0.)

We are given a string

S

of

'0'

s and

'1'

s, and we may flip any

'0'

to a

'1'

or a

'1'

to a

'0'

.

Return the minimum number of flips to make

S

monotone increasing.

Example 1:

Input:

"00110"

Output:

1

Explanation:

We flip the last digit to get 00111.

Example 2:

Input:

"010110"

Output:

2

Explanation:

We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.

Example 3:

Input:

"00011000"

Output:

2

Explanation:

We flip to get 00000000.

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 20000

S

only consists of

'0'

and

'1'

characters.

# 927. Three Equal Parts

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/927.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/927.html)

**Companies:** Hotstar

## Description

Given an array

A

of

0

s and

1

s, divide the array into 3
        non-empty parts such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.

If it is possible, return

any

[i, j]

with

i+1 <
        j

, such that:

A[0], A[1], ..., A[i]

is the first part;

A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[j-1]

is the second part, and

A[j], A[j+1], ..., A[A.length - 1]

is the third part.

All three parts have equal binary value.

If it is not possible, return

[-1, -1]

.

Note that the entire part is used when considering what binary value it represents.  For
        example,

[1,1,0]

represents

6

in decimal, not

3

.  Also, leading zeros are allowed, so

[0,1,1]

and

[1,1]

represent the same value.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,0,1,0,1]

Output:

[0,3]

Example 2:

Input:

[1,1,0,1,1]

Output:

## 0928-minimize-malware-spread-ii.md

# 928. Minimize Malware Spread II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/928.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/928.html)

**Companies:** Dropbox

## Description

(This problem is the same as

Minimize Malware Spread

, with the differences bolded.)

In a network of nodes, each node

i

is directly connected to another node

j

if and only if

graph[i][j] = 1

.

Some nodes

initial

are initially infected by malware.  Whenever two nodes
        are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both
        nodes will be infected by malware.  This spread of malware will continue until no more
        nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose

M(initial)

is the final number of nodes infected with malware in
        the entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove one node from the initial list,

completely removing it and any
        connections from this node to any other node

.  Return the node that if
        removed, would minimize

M(initial)

.  If multiple nodes could be
        removed to minimize

M(initial)

, return such a node with the smallest index.

Example 1:

Input:

graph =

[[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]

, initial =

[0,1]

Output:

0

Example 2:

Input:

graph =

[[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,1]]

, initial =

[0,1]

Output:

1

Example 3:

Input:

graph =

[[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1],[0,0,1,1]]

, initial =

[0,1]

Output:

1

Note:

1 < graph.length = graph[0].length <= 300

0 <= graph[i][j] == graph[j][i] <= 1

graph[i][i] = 1

1 <= initial.length < graph.length

0 <= initial[i] < graph.length

## 0929-unique-email-addresses.md

# 929. Unique Email Addresses

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/929.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/929.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Google

## Description

Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

For example, in

alice@leetcode.com

,

alice

is the local name,
        and

leetcode.com

is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain

'.'

s or

'+'

s.

If you add periods (

'.'

) between some characters in the

local
        name

part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same
        address without dots in the local name.  For example,

"alice.z@leetcode.com"

and

"alicez@leetcode.com"

forward to the same email address. 
        (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)

If you add a plus (

'+'

) in the

local name

, everything
        after the first plus sign will be

ignored

. This allows certain emails
        to be filtered, for example

m.y+name@email.com

will be forwarded to

my@email.com

. 
        (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of

emails

, we send one email to each address in the list.  How
        many different addresses actually receive mails?

Example 1:

Input:

["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]

Output:

2

Explanation:

"

testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com"

actually receive mails

Note:

1 <= emails[i].length <= 100

1 <= emails.length <= 100

Each

emails[i]

contains exactly one

'@'

character.

All local and domain names are non-empty.

Local names do not start with a

'+'

character.

## 0931-minimum-falling-path-sum.md

# 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/931.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/931.html)

**Companies:** Goldman Sachs, Google

## Description

Given a

square

array of integers

A

, we want the

minimum

sum of a

falling path

through

A

.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row. 
        The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's
        column by at most one.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output:

12

Explanation:

The possible falling paths are:

[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]

[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]

[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]

The falling path with the smallest sum is

[1,4,7]

, so the answer is

12

.

## 0936-stamping-the-sequence.md

# 936. Stamping The Sequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/936.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/936.html)

**Companies:** Google, Uber

## Description

You want to form a

target

string of

lowercase letters

.

At the beginning, your sequence is

target.length

'?'

marks.  You also have a

stamp

of lowercase letters.

On each turn, you may place the stamp over the sequence, and replace every letter in the
        sequence with the corresponding letter from the stamp.  You can make up to

10 *
            target.length

turns.

For example, if the initial sequence is

"?????"

, and
        your stamp is

"abc"

,  then you may make

"abc??",
            "?abc?", "??abc"

in the first turn.  (Note that the
        stamp must be fully contained in the boundaries of the sequence in order to stamp.)

If the sequence is possible to stamp, then return an array of the index of the left-most
        letter being stamped at each turn.  If the sequence is not possible to stamp, return an
        empty array.

For example, if the sequence is

"ababc"

, and the
        stamp is

"abc"

, then we could return the answer

[0, 2]

,
        corresponding to the moves

"?????" -> "abc??"
            -> "ababc"

.

Also, if the sequence is possible to stamp, it is guaranteed it is possible to stamp within

10 * target.length

moves.  Any answers specifying more than this
        number of moves will not be accepted.

Example 1:

Input:

stamp =

"abc"

, target =

"ababc"

Output:

[0,2]

([1,0,2] would also be accepted as an answer, as well as some other answers.)

Example 2:

Input:

stamp =

"

abca

"

, target =

"

aabcaca"

[3,0,1]

## Description

You have an array of

logs

.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric

identifier

.  Then,
        either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;

Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.

We will call these two varieties of logs

letter-logs

and

digit-logs

. 
        It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The
        letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in
        case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

Example 1:

Input:

logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]

Output:

["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]

Constraints:

## 0944-delete-columns-to-make-sorted.md

# 944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/944.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/944.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We are given an array

A

of

N

lowercase letter strings, all of
        the same length.

Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the
        characters in those indices.

For example, if we have an array

A = ["

abcdef

","uvwxyz"]

and deletion indices

{0, 2, 3}

, then the final array after deletions is

["bef",
            "vyz"]

, and the remaining columns of

A

are

["b"

,"

v"]

,

["e","y"]

,
        and

["f","z"]

.  (Formally, the

c

-th
        column is

[A[0][c], A[1][c], ..., A[A.length-1][c]]

.)

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices

D

such that after deletions, each
        remaining column in A is in

non-decreasing

sorted order.

Return the minimum possible value of

D.length

.

Example 1:

Input:

["cba","daf","ghi"]

Output:

1

Explanation:

After choosing D = {1}, each column ["c","d","g"] and ["a","f","i"] are in non-decreasing sorted order.
If we chose D = {}, then a column ["b","a","h"] would not be in non-decreasing sorted order.

Example 2:

Input:

["a","b"]

Output:

0

Explanation:

D = {}

Example 3:

Input:

["zyx","wvu","tsr"]

Output:

3

Explanation:

D = {0, 1, 2}

## 0950-reveal-cards-in-increasing-order.md

# 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/950.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/950.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

In a deck of cards, every card has a unique integer.  You can order the deck in any
        order you want.

Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

Now, you do the following steps repeatedly, until all cards are revealed:

Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.

If there are still cards in the deck, put the next top card of the deck at the
            bottom of the deck.

If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, stop.

Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in

increasing
        order.

The first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

Example 1:

Input:

[17,13,11,2,3,5,7]

Output:

[2,13,3,11,5,17,7]

Explanation:

We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order doesn't matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 1000

1 <= A[i] <= 10^6

A[i] != A[j]

for all

i != j

## 0951-flip-equivalent-binary-trees.md

# 951. Flip Equivalent Binary Trees

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/951.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/951.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the
        left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is

flip equivalent

to a binary tree Y if and only if we can
        make X equal to Y after some number of flip operations.

Write a function that determines whether two binary trees are

flip equivalent

. 
        The trees are given by root nodes

root1

and

root2

.

Example 1:

Input:

root1 =

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8]

, root2 =

[1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]

Output:

true

Explanation:

We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.

Note:

Each tree will have at most

100

nodes.

Each value in each tree will be a unique integer in the range

[0, 99]

## 0953-verifying-an-alien-dictionary.md

# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/953.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/953.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft

## Description

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in
        a different

order

. The

order

of the alphabet is some
        permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of

words

written in the alien language, and the

order

of the alphabet, return

true

if and only if the given

words

are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

Example 1:

Input:

words =

["hello","leetcode"]

, order =

"hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"

Output:

true

Explanation:

As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

Example 2:

Input:

words =

["word","world","row"]

, order =

"worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"

Output:

false

Explanation:

As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

Example 3:

Input:

words =

["apple","app"]

, order =

"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

Output:

false

Explanation:

The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (

More info

).

Note:

1 <= words.length <= 100

1 <= words[i].length <= 20

order.length == 26

All characters in

words[i]

and

order

are english
                        lowercase

## Description

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then
            the cell becomes occupied.

Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't

## 0960-delete-columns-to-make-sorted-iii.md

# 960. Delete Columns to Make Sorted III

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/960.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/960.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We are given an array

A

of

N

lowercase letter strings, all of
        the same length.

Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the
        characters in those indices.

For example, if we have an array

A = ["babca","bbazb"]

and
        deletion indices

{0, 1, 4}

, then the final array after deletions is

["bc","az"]

.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices

D

such that after deletions, the
        final array has

every element (row) in lexicographic

order.

For clarity,

A[0]

is in lexicographic order (ie.

A[0][0] <= A[0][1]
        <= ... <= A[0][A[0].length - 1]

),

A[1]

is in lexicographic order
        (ie.

A[1][0] <= A[1][1] <= ... <= A[1][A[1].length - 1]

), and so on.

Return the minimum possible value of

D.length

.

Example 1:

Input:

["babca","bbazb"]

Output:

3

Explanation:

After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is A = ["bc", "az"].
Both these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. A[0][0] <= A[0][1] and A[1][0] <= A[1][1]).
Note that A[0] > A[1] - the array A isn't necessarily in lexicographic order.

Example 2:

Input:

["edcba"]

Output:

4

Explanation:

If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row won't be lexicographically sorted.

Example 3:

Input:

["ghi","def","abc"]

Output:

0

Explanation:

All rows are already lexicographically sorted.

## 0964-least-operators-to-express-number.md

# 964. Least Operators to Express Number

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/964.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/964.html)

**Companies:** Snapchat

## Description

Given a single positive integer

x

, we will write an expression of the form

x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ...

where each operator

op1

,

op2

,
        etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (

+

,

-

,

*

, or

/)

.  For example, with

x =
            3

, we might write

3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3

which is a value of

3

.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

The division operator (

/

) returns rational numbers.

There are no parentheses placed anywhere.

We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happens before
            addition and subtraction.

It's not allowed to use the unary negation operator (

-

).  For
            example, "

x - x

" is a valid expression as it only uses
            subtraction, but "

-x + x

" is not because it uses negation.

We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the
        expression equals the given

target

.  Return the least number of operators
        used.

Example 1:

Input:

x =

3

, target =

19

Output:

5

Explanation:

3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3.  The expression contains 5 operations.

Example 2:

Input:

x =

5

, target =

501

Output:

8

Explanation:

5 * 5 * 5 * 5 - 5 * 5 * 5 + 5 / 5.  The expression contains 8 operations.

Example 3:

Input:

x =

100

, target =

100000000

Output:

3

Explanation:

100 * 100 * 100 * 100.  The expression contains 3 operations.

## 0966-vowel-spellchecker.md

# 966. Vowel Spellchecker

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/966.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/966.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Thumbtack

## Description

Given a

wordlist

, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query
        word into a correct word.

For a given

query

word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling
        mistakes:

Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist
            (

case-insensitive

), then the query word is returned with the same case
            as the case in the wordlist.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
wordlist = ["yellow"]
,
query = "YellOw"
:
correct = "yellow"
Example:
wordlist = ["Yellow"]
,
query = "yellow"
:
correct = "Yellow"
Example:
wordlist = ["yellow"]
,
query = "yellow"
:
correct = "yellow"
Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i',
            'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a
            word in the wordlist (
case-insensitive
), then the query word is
            returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
Example:
wordlist = ["YellOw"]
,
query = "yollow"
:
correct = "YellOw"
Example:
wordlist = ["YellOw"]
,
query = "yeellow"
:
correct = ""
(no match)
Example:
wordlist = ["YellOw"]
,
query = "yllw"
:
correct = ""
(no match)
In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:
When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (
case-sensitive
),
            you should return the same word back.
When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such
            match in the wordlist.
When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match
            in the wordlist.
If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.
Given some
queries
, return a list of words
answer
, where
answer[i]
is the correct word for
query = queries[i]
.
Example 1:
Input:
wordlist =
["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"]
, queries =
["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]
Output:
["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]
Note:
1 <= wordlist.length <= 5000
1 <= queries.length <= 5000
1 <= wordlist[i].length <= 7
1 <= queries[i].length <= 7
All strings in
wordlist
and
queries
consist only of
english
letters.
```

## 0969-pancake-sorting.md

# 969. Pancake Sorting

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/969.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/969.html)

## Description

Given an array

A

, we can perform a

pancake flip

: We choose
        some positive integer

k

<= A.length

, then reverse the
        order of the first

k

elements of

A

.  We want to perform
        zero or more pancake flips (doing them one after another in succession) to sort the array

A

.

Return the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort

A

. 
        Any valid answer that sorts the array within

10 * A.length

flips will be
        judged as correct.

Example 1:

Input:

[3,2,4,1]

Output:

[4,2,4,3]

Explanation:

We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k=4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k=2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k=4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k=3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,2,3]

Output:

[]

Explanation:

The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.

# 971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/971.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/971.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg, Unknown

## Description

Given a binary tree with

N

nodes, each node has a different value
        from

{1, ..., N}

.

A node in this binary tree can be

flipped

by swapping the left child and the
        right child of that node.

Consider the sequence of

N

values reported by a preorder traversal starting
        from the root.  Call such a sequence of

N

values the

voyage

of
        the tree.

(Recall that a

preorder traversal

of a node means we report the current node's
        value, then preorder-traverse the left child, then preorder-traverse the right child.)

Our goal is to flip the

least number

of nodes in the tree so that the voyage
        of the tree matches the

voyage

we are given.

If we can do so, then return a list of the values of all nodes flipped.  You
        may return the answer in any order.

If we cannot do so, then return the list

[-1]

.

Example 1:

Input:

root =

, voyage =

[2,1]

Output:

[-1]

Example 2:

Input:

root =

[1,2,3]

## 0972-equal-rational-numbers.md

# 972. Equal Rational Numbers

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/972.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/972.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Given two strings

S

and

T

, each of which represents a non-negative
        rational number, return

True

if and only if they represent the same number.
        The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.

In general a rational number can be represented using up to three parts: an

integer
        part

, a

non-repeating part,

and a

repeating part

. The
        number will be represented in one of the following three ways:

<IntegerPart>

(e.g. 0, 12, 123)

<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart>

(e.g. 0.5, 1.,
            2.12, 2.0001)

<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart><(><RepeatingPart><)>

(e.g. 0.1(6), 0.9(9), 0.00(1212))

The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round
        brackets.  For example:

1 / 6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66)

Both 0.1(6) or 0.1666(6) or 0.166(66) are correct representations of 1 / 6.

Example 1:

Input:

S =

"0.(52)"

, T =

"0.5(25)"

Output:

true

Explanation:

Because "0.(52)" represents 0.52525252..., and "0.5(25)" represents 0.52525252525..... , the strings represent the same number.

Example 2:

Input:

S =

"0.1666(6)"

, T =

"0.166(66)"

Output:

true

Example 3:

Input:

S =

"0.9(9)"

, T =

"1."

Output:

true

Explanation:

"0.9(9)" represents 0.999999999... repeated forever, which equals 1.  [

See this link for an explanation.

]
"1." represents the number 1, which is formed correctly: (IntegerPart) = "1" and (NonRepeatingPart) = "".

## 0973-k-closest-points-to-origin.md

# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/973.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/973.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Asana, eBay, Expedia, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Paypal, Uber, Yahoo

## Description

We have a list of

points

on the plane.  Find the

K

closest points to the origin

(0, 0)

.

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique
        (except for the order that it is in.)

Example 1:

Input:

points =

[[1,3],[-2,2]]

, K =

1

Output:

[[-2,2]]

Explanation:

The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

Example 2:

Input:

points =

[[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]]

, K =

2

Output:

[[3,3],[-2,4]]

(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)

Note:

1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000

-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000

## 0975-odd-even-jump.md

# 975. Odd Even Jump

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/975.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/975.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given an integer array

A

.  From some starting index, you can
        make a series of jumps.  The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called

odd numbered jumps

, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called

even numbered jumps

.

You may from index

i

jump forward to index

j

(with

i < j

) in the following
        way:

During odd numbered jumps (ie. jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index

j

such that

A[i] <= A[j]

and

A[j]

is the smallest possible value.  If there are multiple such
            indexes

j

, you can only jump to the

smallest

such index

j

.

During even numbered jumps (ie. jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index

j

such that

A[i] >= A[j]

and

A[j]

is the largest possible value.  If there are multiple such
            indexes

j

, you can only jump to the

smallest

such index

j

.

(It may be the case that for some index

i

,

there are no legal jumps.)

A starting index is

good

if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the
        array (index

A.length - 1

) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more
        than once.)

Return the number of good starting indexes.

Example 1:

Input:

[10,13,12,14,15]

Output:

2

Explanation:

From starting index i = 0, we can jump to i = 2 (since A[2] is the smallest among A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4] that is greater or equal to A[0]), then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can jump to i = 3, then we can't jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can jump to i = 4, so we've reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we've reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indexes (i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

Example 2:

Input:

[2,3,1,1,4]

Output:

3

Explanation:

From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:

During our 1st jump (odd numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because A[1] is the smallest value in (A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[0].

During our 2nd jump (even numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because A[2] is the largest value in (A[2], A[3], A[4]) that is less than or equal to A[1].  A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3.

During our 3rd jump (odd numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because A[3] is the smallest value in (A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[2].

We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.

In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indexes (i = 1, i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.

Example 3:

Input:

[5,1,3,4,2]

Output:

3

Explanation:

We can reach the end from starting indexes 1, 2, and 4.

**Companies:** Amazon, Apple, Atlassian, Databricks, Facebook, Flexport, Google, Lyft, Microsoft, Netflix, Sumologic, Twitter, Zillow

## Description

Create a timebased key-value store class

TimeMap

, that supports two
        operations.

1.

set(string key, string value, int timestamp)

Stores the

key

and

value

, along with the given

timestamp

.

2.

get(string key, int timestamp)

Returns a value such that

set(key, value, timestamp_prev)

was called
            previously, with

timestamp_prev <= timestamp

.

If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest

timestamp_prev

.

If there are no values, it returns the empty string (

""

).

Example 1:

Input:

inputs =

Output:

[null,null,"bar","bar",null,"bar2","bar2"]

Explanation:

TimeMap kv;  
kv.set("foo", "bar", 1); // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1  
kv.get("foo", 1);  // output "bar"  
kv.get("foo", 3); // output "bar" since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 ie "bar"  
kv.set("foo", "bar2", 4);  
kv.get("foo", 4); // output "bar2"  
kv.get("foo", 5); //output "bar2"

Example 2:

## 0983-minimum-cost-for-tickets.md

# 983. Minimum Cost For Tickets

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/983.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/983.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Grab, Uber

## Description

In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year
        in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array

days

.  Each day is an integer from

1

to

365

.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for

costs[0]

dollars;

a 7-day pass is sold for

costs[1]

dollars;

a 30-day pass is sold for

costs[2]

dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day
        pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of

days

.

Example 1:

Input:

days =

[1,4,6,7,8,20]

, costs =

[2,7,15]

Output:

11

Explanation:

For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

Example 2:

Input:

days =

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31]

, costs =

[2,7,15]

Output:

17

Explanation:

For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

# 985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/985.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/985.html)

**Companies:** Indeed

## Description

We have an array

A

of integers, and an array

queries

of
        queries.

For the

i

-th query

val = queries[i][0], index =
        queries[i][1]

, we add

val

to

A[index]

. 
        Then, the answer to the

i

-th query is the sum of the even values of

A

.

(Here, the given

index = queries[i][1]

is a 0-based index, and each query
        permanently modifies the array

A

.)

Return the answer to all queries.  Your

i

-th query.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

, queries =

[[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]

Output:

[8,6,2,4]

Explanation:

At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to A[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to A[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to A[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to A[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000

-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000

## 0987-vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree.md

# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/987.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/987.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Bloomberg, Databricks, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Samsung

## Description

Given a binary tree, return the

vertical order

traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position

(X, Y)

, its left and right children respectively will
        be at positions

(X-1, Y-1)

and

(X+1, Y-1)

.

Running a vertical line from

X = -infinity

to

X = +infinity

,
        whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order
        from top to bottom (decreasing

Y

coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the
        value that is smaller.

Return an list of non-empty reports in order of

X

coordinate.  Every
        report will have a list of values of nodes.

Example 1:

Input:

[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output:

[[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]

Explanation:

Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).

Example 2:

Input:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output:

[[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]

Explanation:

The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.

# 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/990.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/990.html)

**Companies:** Sumologic

## Description

Given an array

equations

of strings that represent
        relationships between variables, each string

equations[i]

has length

4

and takes one of two different forms:

"a==b"

or

"a!=b"

. 
        Here,

a

and

b

are lowercase letters (not necessarily different)
        that represent one-letter variable names.

Return

true

if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable
        names so as to satisfy all the given equations.

Example 1:

Input:

["a==b","b!=a"]

Output:

false

Explanation:

If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.

Example 2:

Input:

["b==a","a==b"]

Output:

true

Explanation:

We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.

Example 3:

Input:

["a==b","b==c","a==c"]

Output:

true

Example 4:

Input:

["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]

Output:

false

Example 5:

Input:

["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]

Output:

true

Note:

1 <= equations.length <= 500

equations[i].length == 4

equations[i][0]

and

equations[i][3]

are
                                lowercase letters

## 0994-rotting-oranges.md

# 994. Rotting Oranges

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/994.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/994.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Flipkart

## Description

In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

the value

0

representing an empty cell;

the value

1

representing a fresh orange;

the value

2

representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes
        rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. 
        If this is impossible, return

-1

instead.

Example 1:

Input:

[[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]

Output:

4

Example 2:

Input:

[[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

Example 3:

Input:

[[0,2]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

Note:

## 0999-available-captures-for-rook.md

# 999. Available Captures for Rook

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/999.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/999.html)

**Companies:** Square

## Description

On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook.  There also may be empty squares, white
        bishops, and black pawns.  These are given as characters 'R', '.',
        'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and
        lowercase characters represent black pieces.

The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north,
        east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the
        edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it
        occupies.  Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.

Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

Example 1:

Input:

[[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","R",".",".",".","p"],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

In this example the rook is able to capture all the pawns.

Example 2:

Input:

[[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".","p","p","p","p","p",".","."],[".","p","p","B","p","p",".","."],[".","p","B","R","B","p",".","."],[".","p","p","B","p","p",".","."],[".","p","p","p","p","p",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

Bishops are blocking the rook to capture any pawn.

Example 3:

## 1000-minimum-cost-to-merge-stones.md

# 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1000.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1000.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

There are

N

piles of stones arranged in a row.  The

i

-th pile
        has

stones[i]

stones.

A

move

consists of merging

exactly

K

consecutive

piles into one pile, and the
        cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these

K

piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible,
        return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

stones =

[3,2,4,1]

, K =

2

Output:

20

Explanation:

We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

Example 2:

Input:

stones =

[3,2,4,1]

, K =

3

Output:

-1

Explanation:

After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.

Example 3:

Input:

stones =

[3,5,1,2,6]

, K =

3

Output:

25

Explanation:

We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 30

2 <= K <= 30

1 <= stones[i] <= 100

## 1001-grid-illumination.md

# 1001. Grid Illumination

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1001.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1001.html)

**Companies:** Dropbox

## Description

On a

N x N

grid of cells, each cell

(x, y)

with

0 <= x
        < N

and

0 <= y < N

has a lamp.

Initially, some number of lamps are on.

lamps[i]

tells us the location of
        the

i

-th lamp that is on.  Each lamp that is on illuminates every square
        on its x-axis, y-axis, and both diagonals (similar to a Queen in chess).

For the i-th query

queries[i] = (x, y)

, the answer to the query is 1 if the
        cell (x, y) is illuminated, else 0.

After each query

(x, y)

[in the order given by

queries

], we turn
        off any lamps that are at cell

(x, y)

or are adjacent 8-directionally
        (ie., share a corner or edge with cell

(x, y)

.)

Return an array of answers.  Each value

answer[i]

should be equal to
        the answer of the

i

-th query

queries[i]

.

Example 1:

Input:

N =

5

, lamps =

[[0,0],[4,4]]

, queries =

[[1,1],[1,0]]

Output:

[1,0]

Explanation:

Before performing the first query we have both lamps [0,0] and [4,4] on.
The grid representing which cells are lit looks like this, where [0,0] is the top left corner, and [4,4] is the bottom right corner:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Then the query at [1, 1] returns 1 because the cell is lit.  After this query, the lamp at [0, 0] turns off, and the grid now looks like this:
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Before performing the second query we have only the lamp [4,4] on.  Now the query at [1,0] returns 0, because the cell is no longer lit.

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^9

0 <= lamps.length <= 20000

0 <= queries.length <= 20000

lamps[i].length == queries[i].length == 2

## 1003-check-if-word-is-valid-after-substitutions.md

# 1003. Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1003.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1003.html)

**Companies:** Nutanix

## Description

We are given that the string

"abc"

is valid.

From any valid string

V

, we may split

V

into two pieces

X

and

Y

such that

X + Y

(

X

concatenated with

Y

) is equal to

V

.  (

X

or

Y

may be
        empty.)  Then,

X + "abc" + Y

is also valid.

If for example

S = "abc"

, then examples of valid strings are:

"abc",
        "aabcbc", "abcabc", "abcabcababcc"

.  Examples of

invalid

strings are:

"abccba"

,

"ab"

,

"cababc"

,

"bac"

.

Return

true

if and only if the given string

S

is valid.

Example 1:

Input:

"aabcbc"

Output:

true

Explanation:

We start with the valid string "abc".
Then we can insert another "abc" between "a" and "bc", resulting in "a" + "abc" + "bc" which is "aabcbc".

Example 2:

Input:

"abcabcababcc"

Output:

true

Explanation:

"abcabcabc" is valid after consecutive insertings of "abc".
Then we can insert "abc" before the last letter, resulting in "abcabcab" + "abc" + "c" which is "abcabcababcc".

Example 3:

Input:

"abccba"

Output:

false

## 1006-clumsy-factorial.md

# 1006. Clumsy Factorial

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1006.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1006.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Normally, the factorial of a positive integer

n

is the product of all
        positive integers less than or equal to

n

.  For example,

factorial(10)
            = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

.

We instead make a

clumsy factorial:

using the integers in decreasing order, we swap
        out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations: multiply (*), divide
        (/), add (+) and subtract (-) in this order.

For example,

clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1

.  However,
        these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic: we do
        all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and
        multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.

Additionally, the division that we use is

floor division

such that

10
        * 9 / 8

equals

11

.  This guarantees the result is an
        integer.

Implement the

clumsy

function as
        defined above: given an integer

N

, it returns the clumsy factorial of

N

.

Example 1:

Input:

4

Output:

7

Explanation:

7 = 4 * 3 / 2 + 1

Example 2:

Input:

10

Output:

12

Explanation:

12 = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1

Note:

1 <= N <= 10000

-2^31 <= answer <= 2^31 - 1

(The answer is guaranteed to fit
            within a 32-bit integer.)

## 1007-minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row.md

# 1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1007.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1007.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

In a row of dominoes,

A[i]

and

B[i]

represent the top and bottom
        halves of the

i

-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to
        6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the

i

-th domino, so that

A[i]

and

B[i]

swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in

A

are the same,
        or all the values in

B

are the same.

If it cannot be done, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

[2,1,2,4,2,2]

, B =

[5,2,6,2,3,2]

Output:

2

Explanation:

The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.

Example 2:

Input:

A =

[3,5,1,2,3]

, B =

[3,6,3,3,4]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of values equal.

## Description

Given an array

A

of integers, return

true

if and only if we can
        partition the array into three

non-empty

parts with equal sums.

Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indexes

i+1 < j

with

(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i] == A[i+1] + A[i+2] + ... + A[j-1] == A[j] + A[j-1] + ... +
            A[A.length - 1])

Example 1:

Input:

[0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1]

Output:

true

Explanation:

0 + 2 + 1 = -6 + 6 - 7 + 9 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1

Example 2:

Input:

[0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1]

Output:

false

Example 3:

Input:

[3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4]

**Companies:** Facebook, Google

## Description

A valid parentheses string is either empty

("")

,

"(" +
        A + ")"

, or

A + B

, where

A

and

B

are
        valid parentheses strings, and

+

represents string concatenation.  For
        example,

""

,

"()"

,

"(())()"

, and

"(()(()))"

are all valid
        parentheses strings.

A valid parentheses string

S

is

primitive

if it is nonempty,
        and there does not exist a way to split it into

S = A+B

, with

A

and

B

nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string

S

, consider its primitive decomposition:

S
        = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_k

, where

P_i

are primitive valid parentheses
        strings.

# 1024. Video Stitching

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1024.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1024.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted

T

seconds.  These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied
        lengths.

Each video clip

clips[i]

is an interval: it starts at time

clips[i][0]

and ends at time

clips[i][1]

.  We can cut these clips into segments
        freely: for example, a clip

[0, 7]

can be cut into segments

[0, 1] + [1,
            3] + [3, 7]

.

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that
        cover the entire sporting event (

[0, T]

).  If the task is impossible,
        return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

clips =

[[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]]

, T =

10

Output:

3

Explanation:

We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].

Example 2:

Input:

clips =

[[0,1],[1,2]]

, T =

5

Output:

-1

Explanation:

We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].

Example 3:

Input:

clips =

[[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]]

, T =

9

Output:

3

Explanation:

We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].

Example 4:

Input:

clips =

[[0,4],[2,8]]

, T =

5

Output:

2

Explanation:

Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.

Note:

1 <= clips.length <= 100

0 <= clips[i][0], clips[i][1] <= 100

0 <= T <= 100

# 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1028.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1028.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, LinkedIn

## Description

We run a preorder depth first search on the

root

of a binary tree.

At each node in this traversal, we output

D

dashes (where

D

is the

depth

of this node), then we output the value of this node.

(If the
            depth of a node is

D

, the depth of its immediate child is

D+1

. 
            The depth of the root node is

0

.)

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.

Given the output

S

of this traversal, recover the tree and return its

root

.

Example 1:

Input:

"1-2--3--4-5--6--7"

Output:

[1,2,5,3,4,6,7]

Example 2:

Input:

"1-2--3---4-5--6---7"

Output:

[1,2,5,3,null,6,null,4,null,7]

## Description

We are given a matrix with

R

rows and

C

columns has cells with
        integer coordinates

(r, c)

, where

0 <= r < R

and

0
            <= c < C

.

(r0, c0)

.

Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from

(r0,
        c0)

from smallest distance to largest distance.  Here, the distance
        between two cells

(r1, c1)

and

(r2, c2)

is the Manhattan distance,

|r1
            - r2| + |c1 - c2|

.  (You may return the answer in any order that satisfies
        this condition.)

Example 1:

Input:

R =

1

, C =

2

, r0 =

0

, c0 =

0

Output:

[[0,0],[0,1]]

# 1033. Moving Stones Until Consecutive

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1033.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1033.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

Three stones are on a number line at positions

a

,

b

, and

c

.

Each turn, you pick up a stone at an endpoint (ie., either the lowest or highest position
        stone), and move it to an unoccupied position between those endpoints.  Formally,
        let's say the stones are currently at positions

x, y, z

with

x < y
            < z

.  You pick up the stone at either position

x

or position

z

, and move that stone to an integer position

k

, with

x <
            k < z

and

k != y

.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive
        positions.

When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made? 
        Return the answer as an length 2 array:

answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]

Example 1:

Input:

a =

1

, b =

2

, c =

5

Output:

a =

3

, b =

5

, c =

1

# 1034. Coloring A Border

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1034.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1034.html)

**Companies:** Booking

## Description

Given a 2-dimensional

grid

of integers, each value in the grid represents
        the color of the grid square at that location.

Two squares belong to the same

connected component

if and only if they have the same
        color and are next to each other in any of the 4 directions.

The

border

of a connected component is all the squares in the connected
        component that are either 4-directionally adjacent to a square not in the
        component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).

Given a square at location

(r0, c0)

in the grid and a

color

, color the border of the connected component of that square with the
        given

color

, and return the final

grid

.

Example 1:

Input:

grid =

[[1,1],[1,2]]

, r0 =

0

, c0 =

0

, color =

## 1035-uncrossed-lines.md

# 1035. Uncrossed Lines

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1035.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1035.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

We write the integers of

A

and

B

(in the order they are given)
        on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw

connecting lines

: a straight line connecting two numbers

A[i]

and

B[j]

such that:

A[i] == B[j]

;

The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can
        only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

[1,4,2]

, B =

[1,2,4]

Output:

2

Explanation:

We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.

Example 2:

Input:

A =

[2,5,1,2,5]

, B =

[10,5,2,1,5,2]

Output:

# 1036. Escape a Large Maze

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1036.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1036.html)

**Companies:** Google, Uipath

## Description

In a 1 million by 1 million grid, the coordinates of each grid square are

(x, y)

with

0 <= x, y < 10^6

.

We start at the

source

square and want to reach the

target

square. 
        Each move, we can walk to a 4-directionally adjacent square in the grid that isn't in
        the given list of

blocked

squares.

Return

true

if and only if it is possible to reach the target square through a
        sequence of moves.

Example 1:

Input:

blocked =

[[0,1],[1,0]]

, source =

[0,0]

, target =

[0,2]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The target square is inaccessible starting from the source square, because we can't walk outside the grid.

Example 2:

Input:

blocked =

[]

, source =

[0,0]

, target =

[999999,999999]

Output:

true

Explanation:

Because there are no blocked cells, it's possible to reach the target square.

Note:

0 <= blocked.length <= 200

blocked[i].length == 2

0 <= blocked[i][j] < 10^6

# 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1039.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1039.html)

**Companies:** Uber

## Description

Given

N

, consider a convex

N

-sided polygon with vertices labelled

A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1]

in clockwise order.

Suppose you triangulate the polygon into

N-2

triangles.  For each triangle,
        the value of that triangle is the

product

of the labels of the
        vertices, and the

total score

of the triangulation is the sum of these values over
        all

N-2

triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the
        polygon.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,2,3]

Output:

6

Explanation:

The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.

Example 2:

Input:

[3,7,4,5]

Output:

144

Explanation:

There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.

Example 3:

Input:

[1,3,1,4,1,5]

Output:

13

Explanation:

The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.

# 1040. Moving Stones Until Consecutive II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1040.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1040.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

On an

infinite

number line, the position of the i-th stone is given by

stones[i]

. 
        Call a stone an

endpoint stone

if it has the smallest or largest position.

Each turn, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is
        no longer an endpoint stone.

In particular, if the stones are at say,

stones = [1,2,5]

, you

cannot

move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3)
        will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive
        positions.

When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made? 
        Return the answer as an length 2 array:

answer = [minimum_moves,
            maximum_moves]

Example 1:

Input:

[7,4,9]

Output:

[1,2]

Explanation:

We can move 4 -> 8 for one move to finish the game.
Or, we can move 9 -> 5, 4 -> 6 for two moves to finish the game.

Example 2:

Input:

[6,5,4,3,10]

Output:

[2,3]

We can move 3 -> 8 then 10 -> 7 to finish the game.
Or, we can move 3 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 5 -> 9 to finish the game.
Notice we cannot move 10 -> 2 to finish the game, because that would be an illegal move.

## 1046-last-stone-weight.md

# 1046. Last Stone Weight

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1046.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1046.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two

heaviest

rocks and smash them
        together.  Suppose the stones have weights

x

and

y

with

x <= y

.  The result of this smash is:

If

x == y

, both stones are totally destroyed;

If

x != y

, the stone of weight

x

is totally destroyed, and the
            stone of weight

y

has new weight

y-x

.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if
        there are no stones left.)

Example 1:

Input:

[2,7,4,1,8,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1047.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1047.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Google, Oracle, PayTM

## Description

Given a string

S

of lowercase letters, a

duplicate removal

consists of
        choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is
        guaranteed the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input:

"abbaca"

Output:

"ca"

Explanation:

For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 20000

S

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1055.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1055.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

From any string, we can form a

subsequence

of that string by deleting some number of
        characters (possibly no deletions).

Given two strings

source

and

target

, return the minimum number of
        subsequences of

source

such that their concatenation equals

target

.
        If the task is impossible, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

source =

"abc"

, target =

"abcbc"

Output:

2

Explanation:

The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are subsequences of source "abc".

Example 2:

Input:

source =

"abc"

, target =

"acdbc"

Output:

-1

Explanation:

The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of source string due to the character "d" in target string.

Example 3:

Input:

source =

"xyz"

, target =

"xzyxz"

Output:

3

Explanation:

The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".

Constraints:

Both the

source

and

target

strings consist of only lowercase
            English letters from "a"-"z".

The lengths of

is a valid number but the value remains the same, thus

11

is not a confusing number.

Example 4:

Input:

25

Output:

false

Explanation:

We get an invalid number after rotating

25

.

Note:

0 <= N <= 10^9

After the rotation we can ignore leading zeros, for example if after rotation we have

0008

then this number is considered as just

8

.

## 1057-campus-bikes.md

# 1057. Campus Bikes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1057.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1057.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, ByteDance, Google

## Description

On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are

N

workers and

M

bikes, with

N <= M

. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose
        the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign
        the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest
        Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple
        ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process
        until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points

p1

and

p2

is

Manhattan(p1,
        p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|

.

Return a vector

ans

of length

N

, where

ans[i]

is the
        index (0-indexed) of the bike that the

i

-th worker is assigned to.

Example 1:

Input:

workers =

[[0,0],[2,1]]

, bikes =

[[1,2],[3,3]]

Output:

[1,0]

Explanation:

Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].

Example 2:

Input:

workers =

[[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]]

, bikes =

[[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]

Output:

[0,2,1]

Explanation:

Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2, thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2, and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].

Note:

0 <= workers[i][j], bikes[i][j] < 1000

All worker and bike locations are distinct.

1 <= workers.length <= bikes.length <= 1000

## Description

Given an array of prices

[p

1

,p

2

...,p

n

]

and a

target

, round each price

p

i

to

Round

i

(p

i

)

so that the rounded array

[Round

1

(p

1

),Round

2

(p

2

)...,Round

n

(p

n

)]

sums to the given

target

. Each operation

Round

i

(p

i

)

could be either

Floor(p

i

)

or

Ceil(p

i

)

.

Return the string

"-1"

if the rounded array is impossible to sum to

target

. Otherwise, return the smallest rounding error, which is defined as
        Σ |Round

i

(p

i

) - (p

i

)| for

i

from 1 to

n

, as a string with three places after the decimal.

Example 1:

Input:

prices =

["0.700","2.800","4.900"]

, target =

8

Output:

"1.000"

Explanation:

Use Floor, Ceil and Ceil operations to get (0.7 - 0) + (3 - 2.8) + (5 - 4.9) = 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0 .

Example 2:

Input:

prices =

["1.500","2.500","3.500"]

, target =

10

Output:

"-1"

Explanation:

It is impossible to meet the target.

Note:

1 <= prices.length <= 500

.

Each string of prices

prices[i]

represents a real number which is between 0
            and 1000 and has exactly 3 decimal places.

## 1059-all-paths-from-source-lead-to-destination.md

# 1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1059.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1059.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given the

edges

of a directed graph, and two nodes

source

and

destination

of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from

source

eventually end at

destination

, that is:

At least one path exists from the

source

node to the

destination

node

If a path exists from the

source

node to a node with no outgoing edges,
            then that node is equal to

destination

.

The number of possible paths from

source

to

destination

is a
            finite number.

Return

true

if and only if all roads from

source

lead to

destination

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 3, edges =

[[0,1],[0,2]]

, source =

0

, destination = 2

Output:

false

Explanation:

It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.

Example 2:

Input:

n =

4

, edges =

[[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]]

, source =

0

, destination =

3

Output:

false

Explanation:

We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.

Example 3:

Input:

n =

4

, edges =

[[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]

, source =

0

, destination =

3

Output:

true

Example 4:

Input:

n =

3

, edges =

[[0,1],[1,1],[1,2]]

, source =

0

, destination =

2

Output:

false

Explanation:

All paths from the source node end at the destination node, but there are an infinite number of paths, such as 0-1-2, 0-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-1-2, and so on.

Example 5:

Input:

n =

2

, edges =

[[0,1],[1,1]]

, source =

0

, destination =

1

Output:

false

Explanation:

There is infinite self-loop at destination node.

Note:

The given graph may have self loops and parallel edges.

The number of nodes

n

in the graph is between

1

and

10000

The number of edges in the graph is between

0

and

10000

0 <= edges.length <= 10000

## 1061-lexicographically-smallest-equivalent-string.md

# 1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1061.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1061.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given strings

A

and

B

of the same length, we say A[i] and B[i] are
        equivalent characters. For example, if

A = "abc"

and

B = "cde"

,
        then we have

'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', 'c' ==
            'e'

.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'

Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'

Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a'
            == 'c'

For example, given the equivalency information from

A

and

B

above,

S = "eed"

,

"acd"

, and

"aab"

are equivalent strings, and

"aab"

is the
        lexicographically smallest equivalent string of

S

.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of

S

by using the
        equivalency information from

A

and

B

.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

"parker"

, B =

"morris"

, S =

"parser"

Output:

"makkek"

Explanation:

Based on the equivalency information in

A

and

B

, we can group their characters as

[m,p]

,

[a,o]

,

[k,r,s]

,

[e,i]

. The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order. So the answer is

"makkek"

.

Example 2:

Input:

A =

"hello"

, B =

"world"

, S =

"hold"

Output:

"hdld"

Explanation:

Based on the equivalency information in

A

and

B

, we can group their characters as

[h,w]

,

[d,e,o]

,

[l,r]

. So only the second letter

'o'

in

S

is changed to

'd'

, the answer is

"hdld"

.

Example 3:

Input:

A =

"leetcode"

, B =

"programs"

, S =

"sourcecode"

Output:

"aauaaaaada"

Explanation:

We group the equivalent characters in

A

and

B

as

[a,o,e,r,s,c]

,

[l,p]

,

[g,t]

and

[d,m]

, thus all letters in

S

except

'u'

and

'd'

are transformed to

'a'

, the answer is

"aauaaaaada"

.

Note:

String

A

,

B

and

S

consist of only lowercase
            English letters from

'a'

-

'z'

.

The lengths of string

A

,

B

and

S

are between

1

and

1000

.

String

A

and

B

are of the same length.

## Description

On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are

N

workers and

M

bikes, with

N <= M

. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between
        each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

The Manhattan distance between two points

p1

and

p2

is

Manhattan(p1,
        p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|

.

Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned
        bike.

Example 1:

Input:

workers =

[[0,0],[2,1]]

, bikes =

[[1,2],[3,3]]

Output:

6

Explanation:

We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.

Example 2:

Input:

workers =

[[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]]

, bikes =

[[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]

Output:

4

Explanation:

We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.

Note:

0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000

## Description

Given an array

A

of positive integers, let

S

be the sum of the
        digits of the minimal element of

A

.

Return 0 if

S

is odd, otherwise return 1.

Example 1:

Input:

[34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8]

Output:

0

Explanation:

The minimal element is 1, and the sum of those digits is S = 1 which is odd, so the answer is 0.

Example 2:

Input:

[99,77,33,66,55]

Output:

1

Explanation:

The minimal element is 33, and the sum of those digits is S = 3 + 3 = 6 which is even, so the answer is 1.

top five scores

in

the order of each student's id

.

Each entry

items[i]

has

# 1088. Confusing Number II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1088.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1088.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 are rotated 180
        degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively. When 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are rotated 180
        degrees, they become invalid.

A

confusing number

is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a

different

number with each digit valid.(Note that the rotated number can be greater than the original
        number.)

Given a positive integer

N

, return the number of confusing numbers between

1

and

N

inclusive.

Example 1:

Input:

20

Output:

6

Explanation:

The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19].
6 converts to 9.
9 converts to 6.
10 converts to 01 which is just 1.
16 converts to 91.
18 converts to 81.
19 converts to 61.

Example 2:

Input:

100

Output:

19

Explanation:

The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19,60,61,66,68,80,81,86,89,90,91,98,99,100].

# 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1092.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1092.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Given two strings

str1

and

str2

, return the shortest string
        that has both

str1

and

str2

as subsequences.  If
        multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T
        (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen

anywhere

from T) results in the string S.)

Example 1:

Input:

str1 =

"abac"

, str2 =

"cab"

Output:

"cabac"

Explanation:

str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.

Note:

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000

str1

and

str2

consist of lowercase English letters.

# 1095. Find in Mountain Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1095.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1095.html)

**Companies:** Apple, Google

## Description

(This problem is an

interactive problem

.)

You may recall that an array

A

is a

mountain array

if and only if:

A.length >= 3

There exists some

i

with

0 < i < A.length -
            1

such that:

A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]

A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]

Given a mountain array

mountainArr

, return the

minimum

index

such that

mountainArr.get(index) == target

.  If such an

index

doesn't
        exist, return

-1

.

You can't access the mountain array directly.

You may only access
        the array using a

MountainArray

interface:

MountainArray.get(k)

returns the element of the array at index

k

(0-indexed).

MountainArray.length()

returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than

100

calls to

MountainArray.get

will
        be judged

Wrong Answer

.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the
        judge will result in disqualification.

Example 1:

Input:

array = [1,2,3,4,5,3,1], target = 3

Output:

2

Explanation:

3 exists in the array, at index=2 and index=5. Return the minimum index, which is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

array = [0,1,2,4,2,1], target = 3

Output:

-1

Explanation:

3 does not exist in

the array,

so we return -1.

Constraints:

3 <= mountain_arr.length() <= 10000

0 <= target <= 10^9

0 <= mountain_arr.get(index) <= 10^9

## 1096-brace-expansion-ii.md

# 1096. Brace Expansion II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1096.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1096.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Google

## Description

Under a grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words.  Let's use

R(expr)

to denote the

set

of words the expression
        represents.

Grammar can best be understood through simple examples:

Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.

R("a") = {"a"}

R("w") = {"w"}

When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions, we take the union of
            possibilities.

R("{a,b,c}") =
                    {"a","b","c"}

R("{{a,b},{b,c}}") =
                    {"a","b","c"}

(notice the final set
                    only contains each word at most once)

When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between
            two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes
            from the second expression.

R("{a,b}{c,d}") = {"ac","ad","bc","bd"}

R("a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}") = {"abdfg", "abdfh",
                    "abefg", "abefh", "acdfg", "acdfh",
                    "acefg", "acefh"}

Formally, the 3 rules for our grammar:

For every lowercase letter

x

, we have

R(x) = {x}

For expressions

e_1, e_2, ... , e_k

with

k >= 2

, we
            have

R({e_1,e_2,...}) = R(e_1) ∪ R(e_2) ∪ ...

For expressions

e_1

and

e_2

, we have

R(e_1 + e_2) =
            {a + b for (a, b) in R(e_1) × R(e_2)}

, where + denotes
            concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

Given an

expression

representing a set of words under the given grammar, return
        the sorted list of words that the expression represents.

Example 1:

Input:

"{a,b}{c,{d,e}}"

Output:

["ac","ad","ae","bc","bd","be"]

Example 2:

Input:

"{{a,z},a{b,c},{ab,z}}"

Output:

["a","ab","ac","z"]

Explanation:

Each distinct word is written only once in the final answer.

Constraints:

1 <= expression.length <= 60

expression[i]

consists of

'{'

,

'}'

,

','

or lowercase English letters.

The given

expression

represents a set of words based on
                    the
                    grammar given in the description.

# 1097. Game Play Analysis V

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1097.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1097.html)

**Companies:** GSN Games

## Description

Table:

Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.

We define the

install date

of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define

day 1 retention

of some date

X

to be the
        number of players whose install date is

X

and they logged back
        in on the day right after

X

, divided by the number of players whose install
        date is

X

,

rounded to 2 decimal places

.

Write an SQL query that reports for each

install date

, the

number of
        players

that installed the game on that day and the

day 1
        retention

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+----------------+
| install_dt | installs | Day1_retention |
+------------+----------+----------------+
| 2016-03-01 | 2        | 0.50           |
| 2017-06-25 | 1        | 0.00           |
+------------+----------+----------------+
Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00

# 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1101.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1101.html)

**Companies:** Expedia

## Description

In a social group, there are

N

people, with unique integer ids from

0

to

N-1

.

We have a list of

logs

, where each

logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A,
        id_B]

contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different
        people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship
        is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.

Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a
        friend of someone acquainted with B.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person.
        Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.

Example 1:

Input:

logs =

[[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]]

, N =

6

Output:

20190301

Explanation:

The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend anything happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.

Note:

2 <= N <= 100

1 <= logs.length <= 10^4

0 <= logs[i][0] <= 10^9

0 <= logs[i][1], logs[i][2] <= N - 1

It's guaranteed that all timestamps in

logs[i][0]

are different.

logs

are not necessarily ordered by some criteria.

logs[i][1] != logs[i][2]

## 1103-distribute-candies-to-people.md

# 1103. Distribute Candies to People

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1103.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1103.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

We distribute some number of

candies

, to a row of

n = num_people

people
        in the following way:

We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we
        give

n

candies to the last person.

Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving

n + 1

candies to the first
        person,

n + 2

candies to the second person, and so on until we give

2
            * n

candies to the last person.

This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the
        row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.  The last person will receive
        all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift).

Return an array (of length

num_people

and sum

candies

) that
        represents the final distribution of candies.

Example 1:

Input:

candies = 7, num_people = 4

Output:

[1,2,3,1]

Explanation:

On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0,0].
On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0,0].
On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3,0].
On the fourth turn, ans[3] += 1 (because there is only one candy left), and the final array is [1,2,3,1].

Example 2:

Input:

candies = 10, num_people = 3

Output:

[5,2,3]

Explanation:

On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0].
On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0].
On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3].
On the fourth turn, ans[0] += 4, and the final array is [5,2,3].

# 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1104.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1104.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Microsoft

## Description

In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row
        order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right,
        while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to
        left.

Given the

label

of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the
        root of the tree to the node with that

label

.

Example 1:

Input:

label = 14

Output:

[1,3,4,14]

Example 2:

Input:

label = 26

Output:

[1,2,6,10,26]

## 1105-filling-bookcase-shelves.md

# 1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1105.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1105.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg, Google

## Description

We have a sequence of

books

: the

i

-th book has thickness

books[i][0]

and height

books[i][1]

.

We want to place these books

in order

onto bookcase shelves that have
        total width

shelf_width

.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness
        is

<= shelf_width

), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so
        that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we
        just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process,

the order of the books we place is
        the same order as the given sequence of books

.  For example, if we have an ordered
        list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the
        third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in
        this manner.

Example 1:

Input:

books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4

Output:

6

Explanation:

The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.

Constraints:

1 <= books.length <= 1000

1 <= books[i][0] <= shelf_width <= 1000

1 <= books[i][1] <= 1000

**Companies:** Bloomreach

## Description

A string is a

valid parentheses string

(denoted VPS) if and only if it consists
        of

"("

and

")"

characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or

It can be written as

AB

(

A

concatenated with

B

),
            where

A

and

B

are VPS's, or

It can be written as

(A)

, where

A

is a VPS.

We can similarly define the

nesting depth

depth(S)

of any VPS

S

as follows:

depth("") = 0

depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))

, where

A

and

B

are VPS's

depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A)

, where

A

is a VPS.

For example,

""

,

"()()"

,
        and

"()(()())"

are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and
        2), and

")("

and

"(()"

are not VPS's.

Given a VPS

seq

, split it into two disjoint subsequences

A

and

B

, such that

A

and

B

are VPS's (and

A.length
            + B.length = seq.length

).

Now choose

any

such

A

and

B

such that

max(depth(A),
        depth(B))

is the minimum possible value.

Return an

answer

array (of length

seq.length

) that encodes such a choice
        of

A

and

B

:

answer[i] = 0

if

seq[i]

is part of

A

, else

answer[i] = 1

.  Note
        that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

Example 1:

Input:

seq = "(()())"

Output:

[0,1,1,1,1,0]

Example 2:

Input:

seq = "()(())()"

Output:

, and

third()

is executed after

second()

.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,2,3]

Output:

"firstsecondthird"

Explanation:

There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,3,2]

Output:

"firstsecondthird"

Explanation:

The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

Note:

We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the
        numbers in the input seems to imply the ordering. The input format you see is mainly to
        ensure our tests' comprehensiveness.

## 1117-building-h2o.md

# 1117. Building H2O

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1117.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1117.html)

**Companies:** LinkedIn

## Description

There are two kinds of threads,

oxygen

and

hydrogen

. Your goal is
        to group these threads to form water molecules. There is a barrier where each thread
        has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will
        be given

releaseHydrogen

and

releaseOxygen

methods
        respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the
        barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to
        form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond

before

any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:

If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has
            to wait for two hydrogen threads.

If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to
            wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads
        do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that
        threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that
        bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two
        hydrogen threads.

Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these
        constraints.

## 1120-maximum-average-subtree.md

# 1120. Maximum Average Subtree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1120.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1120.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Atlassian

## Description

Given the

root

of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree
        of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of
        a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

Example 1:

Input:

[5,6,1]

Output:

6.00000

Explanation:

For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is between

1

and

5000

.

Each node will have a value between

0

and

100000

.

Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within

10^-5

of the correct
            answer.

An active business is a business that has more than one event type with occurences
        greater than the average occurences of that event type among all businesses.

The query result format is in the following example:

Events table:
+-------------+------------+------------+
| business_id | event_type | occurences |
+-------------+------------+------------+
| 1           | reviews    | 7          |

| 2           | page views | 12         |
+-------------+------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| business_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
Average for 'reviews', 'ads' and 'page views' are (7+3)/2=5, (11+7+6)/3=8, (3+12)/2=7.5 respectively.
Business with id 1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8) so it is an active business.

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Consider a directed graph, with nodes labelled

0, 1, ..., n-1

.  In this
        graph, each edge is either red or blue, and there could be self-edges or parallel
        edges.

Each

[i, j]

in

red_edges

denotes a red directed edge from node

i

to node

j

.  Similarly, each

[i, j]

in

blue_edges

denotes a blue directed edge from node

i

to node

j

.

Return an array

answer

of length

n

, where
        each

answer[X]

is the length of the shortest path from node

0

to node

X

such that the edge colors alternate along
        the path (or

-1

if such a path doesn't exist).

Example 1:

Input:

n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], blue_edges = []

Output:

[0,1,-1]

Example 2:

Input:

n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1]], blue_edges = [[2,1]]

Output:

[0,1,-1]

Example 3:

Input:

n = 3, red_edges = [[1,0]], blue_edges = [[2,1]]

Output:

[0,-1,-1]

Example 4:

Input:

n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1]], blue_edges = [[1,2]]

Output:

[0,1,2]

Example 5:

Input:

n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], blue_edges = [[1,0]]

Output:

[0,1,1]

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100

red_edges.length <= 400

blue_edges.length <= 400

red_edges[i].length == blue_edges[i].length == 2

0 <= red_edges[i][j], blue_edges[i][j] < n

# 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1130.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1130.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Mathworks

## Description

Given an array

arr

of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

Each node has either 0 or 2 children;

The values of

arr

correspond to the values of
            each

leaf

in an in-order traversal of the tree.

(Recall
                that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)

The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value
            in its left and right subtree respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the
        values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit
        integer.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [6,2,4]

Output:

32

Explanation:

There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

    24            24
   /  \          /  \

 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 40

1 <= arr[i] <= 15

It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less
            than

2^31

).

+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    |
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action such as a reason for report or a type of reaction.

Table:

Removals

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| post_id       | int     |
| remove_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that some post was removed as a result of being reported or as a result of an admin review.

Write an SQL query to find the average for daily percentage of posts that got removed
        after being reported as spam,

rounded to 2 decimal places

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |

| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+

Result table:
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts was removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.

## 1135-connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost.md

# 1135. Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1135.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1135.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Uber

## Description

There are

N

cities numbered from 1 to

N

.

You are given

connections

, where each

connections[i] = [city1, city2,
        cost]

represents the cost to connect

city1

and

city2

together.  (A

connection

is bidirectional: connecting

city1

and

city2

is the same as connecting

city2

and

city1

.)

Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of
        connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.  The cost
        is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:

Input:

N = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]

Output:

6

Explanation:

Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.

Example 2:

Input:

N = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.

Note:

1 <= N <= 10000

1 <= connections.length <= 10000

1 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= N

0 <= connections[i][2] <= 10^5

.

In one semester you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the
        prerequisites for the course you are studying.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses.  If there is no way
        to study all the courses, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

N =

3

, relations =

[[1,3],[2,3]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

In the first semester, courses 1 and 2 are studied. In the second semester, course 3 is studied.

Example 2:

Input:

# 1140. Stone Game II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1140.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1140.html)

**Companies:** ByteDance(Toutiao)

## Description

Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles

arranged
        in a row

, and each pile has a positive integer number of
        stones

piles[i]

.  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially,

M = 1

.

On each player's turn, that player can take

all the stones

in the

first

X

remaining piles, where

1 <= X <= 2M

. 
        Then, we set

M = max(M, X)

.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

Example 1:

Input:

piles = [2,7,9,4,4]

Output:

10

Explanation:

If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger.

# 1142. User Activity for the Past 30 Days II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1142.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1142.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

Table:

Activity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website.
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.

Write an SQL query to find the average number of sessions per user for a period of 30 days
        ending

2019-07-27

inclusively,

rounded to 2 decimal
            places

. The sessions we want to count for a user are those with at least one
        activity in that time period.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |

| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | scroll_down   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+

Result table:
+---------------------------+
| average_sessions_per_user |
+---------------------------+
| 1.33                      |
+---------------------------+

# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1143.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1143.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft

## Description

Given two strings

text1

and

text2

, return the length of their
        longest common subsequence.

A

subsequence

of a string is a new string generated from the original string with
        some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining
        characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec"
        is not). A

common subsequence

of two strings is a subsequence that is
        common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example 1:

Input:

text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"

Output:

3

Explanation:

The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"

Output:

3

Explanation:

The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:

Input:

text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"

Output:

0

Explanation:

There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Constraints:

1 <= text1.length <= 1000

1 <= text2.length <= 1000

The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array

nums

of integers, a

move

consists of choosing any
        element and

decreasing it by 1

.

An array

A

is a

zigzag array

if either:

Every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie.

A[0] >
            A[1] < A[2] > A[3] < A[4] > ...

OR, every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie.

A[0]
            < A[1] > A[2] < A[3] > A[4] < ...

Return the minimum number of moves to transform the given array

nums

into a

## 1145-binary-tree-coloring-game.md

# 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1145.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1145.html)

**Companies:** Google, Microsoft

## Description

Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the

root

of this binary tree, and the number of nodes

n

in the
        tree.

n

is odd, and each node has a distinct value from

1

to

n

.

Initially, the first player names a value

x

with

1 <= x <= n

,
        and the second player names a value

y

with

1 <= y <= n

and

y != x

.  The first player colors the node with value

x

red,
        and the second player colors the node with value

y

blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player
        chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an

uncolored

neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen
        node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their
        turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player
        that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a

y

to
        ensure you win the game, return

true

.  If it is not possible, return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3

Output:

true

Explanation:

The second player can choose the node with value 2.

Constraints:

root

is the root of a binary tree with

n

nodes and distinct
            node values from

1

to

n

.

n

is odd.

1 <= x <= n <= 100

snap_id

: the total number of times we called

snap()

minus

1

.

int get(index, snap_id)

returns the value at the given

index

, at the time we took the snapshot with the given

snap_id

Example 1:

Input:

["SnapshotArray","set","snap","set","get"]
[[3],[0,5],[],[0,6],[0,0]]

Output:

[null,null,0,null,5]

Explanation:

## 1150-check-if-a-number-is-majority-element-in-a-sorted-array.md

# 1150. Check If a Number Is Majority Element in a Sorted Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1150.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1150.html)

**Companies:** Salesforce

## Description

Given an array

nums

sorted in

non-decreasing

order, and a
        number

target

, return

True

if and only if

target

is a
        majority element.

A

majority element

is an element that appears

more than

N/2

times in an array of length

N

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums =

[2,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6]

, target =

5

Output:

true

Explanation:

The value 5 appears 5 times and the length of the array is 9.
Thus, 5 is a majority element because 5 > 9/2 is true.

Example 2:

Input:

nums =

[10,100,101,101]

, target =

101

Output:

false

Explanation:

The value 101 appears 2 times and the length of the array is 4.
Thus, 101 is not a majority element because 2 > 4/2 is false.

Note:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000

1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

1 <= target <= 10^9

# 1151. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1151.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1151.html)

**Companies:** Expedia

## Description

Given a binary array

data

, return the minimum number of swaps required
        to group all

1

’s present in the array together in

any
            place

in the array.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,0,1,0,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.

Example 2:

Input:

[0,0,0,1,0]

Output:

0

Explanation:

Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.

Example 3:

Input:

[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]

Output:

3

Explanation:

One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].

## 1152-analyze-user-website-visit-pattern.md

# 1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1152.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1152.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

We are given some website visits: the user with name

username[i]

visited
        the website

website[i]

at time

timestamp[i]

.

A

3-sequence

is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by
        the time of their visits.  (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)

Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one
        solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.

Example 1:

Input:

username =

["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"]

, timestamp =

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

, website =

["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]

Output:

["home","about","career"]

Explanation:

The tuples in this example are:
["joe", 1, "home"]
["joe", 2, "about"]
["joe", 3, "career"]
["james", 4, "home"]
["james", 5, "cart"]
["james", 6, "maps"]
["james", 7, "home"]
["mary", 8, "home"]
["mary", 9, "about"]
["mary", 10, "career"]
The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by

2

users.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.

Note:

3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50

1 <= username[i].length <= 10

0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9

1 <= website[i].length <= 10

Both

username[i]

and

website[i]

contain only lowercase
            characters.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least 3 websites.

No user visits two websites at the same time.

# 1165. Single-Row Keyboard

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1165.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1165.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There is a special keyboard with

all keys in a single row

.

Given a string

keyboard

of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard
        (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you
        have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your
        finger from index

i

to index

j

is

|i - j|

.

You want to type a string

word

. Write a function to calculate how much time it
        takes to type it with one finger.

Example 1:

Input:

keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", word = "cba"

Output:

4

Explanation:

The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b' then to 0 again to write 'a'.
Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Example 2:

Input:

keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", word = "leetcode"

Output:

73

Constraints:

keyboard.length == 26

keyboard

contains each English lowercase
            letter exactly once in some order.

1 <= word.length <= 10^4

word[i]

is an English lowercase letter.

## 1166-design-file-system.md

# 1166. Design File System

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1166.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1166.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb

## Description

You are asked to design a file system which provides two functions:

createPath(path, value):

Creates a new path and associates a value
            to it if possible and returns

True

. Returns

False

if
            the path already exists or its parent path doesn't exist.

get(path):

Returns the value associated with a path or returns

-1

if
            the path doesn't exist.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the
        form:

/

followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example,

/leetcode

and

/leetcode/problems

are valid paths while
        an empty string and

/

are not.

Implement the two functions.

Please refer to the examples for clarifications.

Example 1:

Input:

["FileSystem","createPath","get"]
[[],["/a",1],["/a"]]

Output:

[null,true,1]

Explanation:

FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();

fileSystem.createPath("/a", 1); // return true
fileSystem.get("/a"); // return 1

Example 2:

Input:

["FileSystem","createPath","createPath","get","createPath","get"]
[[],["/leet",1],["/leet/code",2],["/leet/code"],["/c/d",1],["/c"]]

Output:

[null,true,true,2,false,-1]

Explanation:

FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();

fileSystem.createPath("/leet", 1); // return true
fileSystem.createPath("/leet/code", 2); // return true
fileSystem.get("/leet/code"); // return 2
fileSystem.createPath("/c/d", 1); // return false because the parent path "/c" doesn't exist.
fileSystem.get("/c"); // return -1 because this path doesn't exist.

Constraints:

The number of calls to the two functions is less than or equal to

10^4

in total.

2 <= path.length <= 100

1 <= value <= 10^9

NOTE:

create method has been changed on August 29, 2019 to
        createPath. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

# 1168. Optimize Water Distribution in a Village

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1168.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1168.html)

**Companies:** Google, Yahoo

## Description

There are

n

houses in a village. We want to
        supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house

i

, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost

wells[i]

,
        or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by
        the array

pipes

, where each

pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost]

represents
        the cost to connect

house1

and

house2

together
        using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.

Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10000

wells.length == n

0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5

1 <= pipes.length <= 10000

1 <= pipes[i][0], pipes[i][1] <= n

0 <= pipes[i][2] <= 10^5

pipes[i][0] != pipes[i][1]

## 1169-invalid-transactions.md

# 1169. Invalid Transactions

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1169.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1169.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg

## Description

A transaction is

possibly invalid

if:

the amount exceeds $1000, or;

if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name
            in a different city.

Each transaction string

transactions[i]

consists of comma separated
        values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Given a list of

transactions

, return a list of transactions that are
        possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]

Output:

["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]

Explanation:

The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.

Example 2:

Input:

transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,1200,mtv"]

Output:

["alice,50,1200,mtv"]

Example 3:

Input:

transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","bob,50,1200,mtv"]

Output:

["bob,50,1200,mtv"]

Constraints:

transactions.length <= 1000

Each

transactions[i]

takes the form

"{name},{time},{amount},{city}"

Each

{name}

and

{city}

consist of lowercase English
            letters, and have lengths between

1

and

10

.

Each

{time}

consist of digits, and represent an integer between

0

and

## 1170-compare-strings-by-frequency-of-the-smallest-character.md

# 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1170.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1170.html)

**Companies:** Google, Oracle

## Description

Let's define a function

f(s)

over a non-empty string

s

, which
        calculates the frequency of the smallest character in

s

. For example, if

s = "dcce"

then

f(s) = 2

because the smallest character
        is

"c"

and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string arrays

queries

and

words

, return an integer
        array

answer

, where each

answer[i]

is the number of words
        such that

f(queries[i])

<

f(W)

, where

W

is
        a word in

words

.

Example 1:

Input:

queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]

Output:

[1]

Explanation:

On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").

Example 2:

Input:

queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]

Output:

[1,2]

Explanation:

On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").

Constraints:

1 <= queries.length <= 2000

1 <= words.length <= 2000

1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10

queries[i][j]

,

words[i][j]

# 1175. Prime Arrangements

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1175.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1175.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Return the number of permutations of 1 to

n

so that prime numbers are at prime
        indices (1-indexed.)

(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be
        written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)

Since the answer may be large, return the answer

modulo

10^9 +
        7

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5

Output:

12

Explanation:

For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 100

# 1176. Diet Plan Performance

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1176.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1176.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

A dieter consumes

calories[i]

calories on the

i

-th day.

Given an integer

k

, for

every

consecutive sequence of

k

days (

calories[i], calories[i+1], ..., calories[i+k-1]

for
        all

0 <= i <= n-k

), they look at

T

, the total calories consumed
        during that sequence of

k

days (

calories[i] + calories[i+1] + ... +
            calories[i+k-1]

):

If

T < lower

, they performed poorly on their diet and lose 1 point;

If

T > upper

, they performed well on their diet and gain 1 point;

Otherwise, they performed normally and there is no change in points.

Initially, the dieter has zero points. Return the total number of points the dieter has after
        dieting for

calories.length

days.

Note that the total points can be negative.

Example 1:

Input:

calories = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1, lower = 3, upper = 3

Output:

0

Explanation

: Since k = 1, we consider each element of the array separately and compare it to lower and upper.
calories[0] and calories[1] are less than lower so 2 points are lost.
calories[3] and calories[4] are greater than upper so 2 points are gained.

Example 2:

Input:

calories = [3,2], k = 2, lower = 0, upper = 1

Output:

1

Explanation

: Since k = 2, we consider subarrays of length 2.
calories[0] + calories[1] > upper so 1 point is gained.

Example 3:

Input:

calories = [6,5,0,0], k = 2, lower = 1, upper = 5

Output:

0

Explanation

:
calories[0] + calories[1] > upper so 1 point is gained.
lower <= calories[1] + calories[2] <= upper so no change in points.
calories[2] + calories[3] < lower so 1 point is lost.

Constraints:

1 <= k <= calories.length <= 10^5

0 <= calories[i] <= 20000

0 <= lower <= upper

## 1177-can-make-palindrome-from-substring.md

# 1177. Can Make Palindrome from Substring

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1177.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1177.html)

**Companies:** Akuna Capital

## Description

Given a string

s

, we make queries on substrings of

s

.

For each query

queries[i] = [left, right, k]

, we may

rearrange

the
        substring

s[left], ..., s[right]

, and then choose

up to

k

of them to replace with any lowercase English letter.

If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above,
        the result of the query is

true

. Otherwise, the result is

false

.

Return an array

answer[]

, where

answer[i]

is the result of the

i

-th query

queries[i]

.

Note that: Each letter is counted

individually

for replacement so if
        for example

s[left..right] = "aaa"

, and

k = 2

, we
        can only replace two of the letters.  (Also, note that the initial string

s

is never modified by any query.)

Example :

Input:

s = "abcda", queries = [[3,3,0],[1,2,0],[0,3,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,1]]

Output:

[true,false,false,true,true]

Explanation:

queries[0] : substring = "d", is palidrome.
queries[1] : substring = "bc", is not palidrome.
queries[2] : substring = "abcd", is not palidrome after replacing only 1 character.
queries[3] : substring = "abcd", could be changed to "abba" which is palidrome. Also this can be changed to "baab" first rearrange it "bacd" then replace "cd" with "ab".
queries[4] : substring = "abcda", could be changed to "abcba" which is palidrome.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, queries.length <= 10^5

0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] < s.length

0 <= queries[i][2] <= s.length

s

only contains lowercase English letters.

# 1186. Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1186.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1186.html)

**Companies:** Two Sigma

## Description

Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a

non-empty

subarray
        (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to
        choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least
        one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.

Note that the subarray needs to be

non-empty

after deleting one element.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [1,-2,0,3]

Output:

4

Explanation:

Because we can choose [1, -2, 0, 3] and drop -2, thus the subarray [1, 0, 3] becomes the maximum value.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,-2,-2,3]

Output:

3

Explanation:

We just choose [3] and it's the maximum sum.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [-1,-1,-1,-1]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

The final subarray needs to be non-empty. You can't choose [-1] and delete -1 from it, then get an empty subarray to make the sum equals to 0.

## 1188-design-bounded-blocking-queue.md

# 1188. Design Bounded Blocking Queue

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1188.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1188.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Cloudera, Google, LinkedIn, Oracle, Uber

## Description

Implement a thread safe bounded blocking queue that has the
        following methods:

BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity)

The constructor initializes the queue
            with a maximum

capacity

.

void enqueue(int element)

Adds an

element

to the front of the
            queue. If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer
            full.

int dequeue()

Returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it.
            If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty.

int size()

Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.

Your implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time. Each thread will
        either be a producer thread that only makes calls to the

enqueue

method
        or a consumer thread that only makes calls to the

dequeue

method. The

size

method
        will be called after every test case.

Please do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be
        accepted in an interview.

Example 1:

Input:

1
1
["BoundedBlockingQueue","enqueue","dequeue","dequeue","enqueue","enqueue","enqueue","enqueue","dequeue"]
[[2],[1],[],[],[0],[2],[3],[4],[]]

Output:

[1,0,2,2]

Explanation:

Number of producer threads = 1
Number of consumer threads = 1

BoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(2);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 2.

queue.enqueue(1);   // The producer thread enqueues 1 to the queue.
queue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread calls dequeue and returns 1 from the queue.
queue.dequeue();    // Since the queue is empty, the consumer thread is blocked.
queue.enqueue(0);   // The producer thread enqueues 0 to the queue. The consumer thread is unblocked and returns 0 from the queue.
queue.enqueue(2);   // The producer thread enqueues 2 to the queue.
queue.enqueue(3);   // The producer thread enqueues 3 to the queue.
queue.enqueue(4);   // The producer thread is blocked because the queue's capacity (2) is reached.
queue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread returns 2 from the queue. The producer thread is unblocked and enqueues 4 to the queue.
queue.size();       // 2 elements remaining in the queue. size() is always called at the end of each test case.

Example 2:

Input:

3
4
["BoundedBlockingQueue","enqueue","enqueue","enqueue","dequeue","dequeue","dequeue","enqueue"]
[[3],[1],[0],[2],[],[],[],[3]]

Output:

[1,0,2,1]

Explanation:

Number of producer threads = 3
Number of consumer threads = 4

BoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(3);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 3.

queue.enqueue(1);   // Producer thread P1 enqueues 1 to the queue.
queue.enqueue(0);   // Producer thread P2 enqueues 0 to the queue.
queue.enqueue(2);   // Producer thread P3 enqueues 2 to the queue.
queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C1 calls dequeue.
queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C2 calls dequeue.
queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C3 calls dequeue.
queue.enqueue(3);   // One of the producer threads enqueues 3 to the queue.
queue.size();       // 1 element remaining in the queue.

Since the number of threads for producer/consumer is greater than 1, we do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the input seems to imply the ordering. Therefore, any of the output [1,0,2] or [1,2,0] or [0,1,2] or [0,2,1] or [2,0,1] or [2,1,0] will be accepted.

## Description

You are given a string

s

that consists of lower case English letters and
        brackets.

Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the
        innermost one.

# 1195. Fizz Buzz Multithreaded

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1195.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1195.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to

n

,
        however:

If the number is divisible by 3, output "fizz".

If the number is divisible by 5, output "buzz".

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "fizzbuzz".

For example, for

n = 15

, we output:

1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz,
        7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz

.

Suppose you are given the following code:

class FizzBuzz {
  public FizzBuzz(int n) { ... }               // constructor
  public void fizz(printFizz) { ... }          // only output "fizz"
  public void buzz(printBuzz) { ... }          // only output "buzz"
  public void fizzbuzz(printFizzBuzz) { ... }  // only output "fizzbuzz"
  public void number(printNumber) { ... }      // only output the numbers
}

Implement a multithreaded version of

FizzBuzz

with

four

threads. The same instance of

FizzBuzz

will be passed to four different
        threads:

Thread A will call

fizz()

to check for divisibility of 3 and
            outputs

fizz

.

Thread B will call

buzz()

to check for divisibility of 5 and
            outputs

buzz

.

Thread C will call

fizzbuzz()

to check for divisibility of 3 and 5 and
            outputs

fizzbuzz

.

Thread D will call

number()

which should only output the numbers.

# 1199. Minimum Time to Build Blocks

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1199.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1199.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given a list of blocks, where

blocks[i] = t

means that
        the

i

-th block needs

t

units of time to be built. A
        block can only be built by exactly one worker.

A worker can either split into two workers (number of workers increases by one) or build a
        block then go home. Both decisions cost some time.

The time cost of spliting one worker into two workers is given as an integer

split

. Note that if two workers split at the same time, they split in parallel
        so the cost would be

split

.

Output the minimum time needed to build all blocks.

Initially, there is only

one

worker.

Example 1:

Input:

blocks = [1], split = 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

We use 1 worker to build 1 block in 1 time unit.

Example 2:

Input:

blocks = [1,2], split = 5

Output:

7

Explanation:

We split the worker into 2 workers in 5 time units then assign each of them to a block so the cost is 5 + max(1, 2) = 7.

Example 3:

Input:

blocks = [1,2,3], split = 1

Output:

4

Explanation:

Split 1 worker into 2, then assign the first worker to the last block and split the second worker into 2.
Then, use the two unassigned workers to build the first two blocks.
The cost is 1 + max(3, 1 + max(1, 2)) = 4.

Constraints:

1 <= blocks.length <= 1000

1 <= blocks[i] <= 10^5

1 <= split <= 100

# 1203. Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1203.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1203.html)

**Companies:** Google, Unknown

## Description

There are

n

items each belonging to zero or one
        of

m

groups where

group[i]

is the group that the

i

-th item belongs to and it's equal to

-1

if the

i

-th item belongs to no group. The items and the groups are zero indexed. A
        group can have no item belonging to it.

Return a sorted list of the items such that:

The items that belong to the same group are next to each other in the sorted list.

There are some relations between these items
            where

beforeItems[i]

is a list containing all the items that
            should come before the

i

-th item in the sorted array (to the left of

Return any solution if there is more than one solution and return an

empty
        list

if there is no solution.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 8, m = 2, group = [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], beforeItems = [[],[6],[5],[6],[3,6],[],[],[]]

Output:

[6,3,4,1,5,2,0,7]

Example 2:

Input:

n = 8, m = 2, group = [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], beforeItems = [[],[6],[5],[6],[3],[],[4],[]]

# 1204. Last Person to Fit in the Elevator

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1204.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1204.html)

**Companies:** Wayfair

## Description

Table:

Queue

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id is the primary key column for this table.
This table has the information about all people waiting for an elevator.
The

person_id

and

turn

columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.

The maximum weight the elevator can hold is

1000

.

Write an SQL query to find the

person_name

of the last person who will fit
        in the elevator without exceeding the weight limit. It is guaranteed that the person who is first
        in the queue can fit in the elevator.

The query result format is in the following example:

Queue table
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name       | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| 5         | George Washington | 250    | 1    |
| 3         | John Adams        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | Thomas Jefferson  | 400    | 3    |
| 2         | Will Johnliams    | 200    | 4    |
| 4         | Thomas Jefferson  | 175    | 5    |
| 1         | James Elephant    | 500    | 6    |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+

Result table
+-------------------+
| person_name       |
+-------------------+
| Thomas Jefferson  |
+-------------------+

Queue table is ordered by turn in the example for simplicity.
In the example George Washington(id 5), John Adams(id 3) and Thomas Jefferson(id 6) will enter the elevator as their weight sum is 250 + 350 + 400 = 1000.
Thomas Jefferson(id 6) is the last person to fit in the elevator because he has the last turn in these three people.

## Description

Table:

Transactions

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| id             | int     |
| country        | varchar |
| state          | enum    |
| amount         | int     |
| trans_date     | date    |
+----------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].

Table:

Chargebacks

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| trans_id       | int     |
| charge_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
Chargebacks contains basic information regarding incoming chargebacks from some transactions placed in Transactions table.
trans_id is a foreign key to the id column of Transactions table.
Each chargeback corresponds to a transaction made previously even if they were not approved.

Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of approved transactions
        and their total amount, the number of chargebacks and their total amount.

Note

: In your query, given the month and country, ignore rows with
        all zeros.

The query result format is in the following example:

Transactions

table:
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| id   | country | state    | amount | trans_date |

## 1206-design-skiplist.md

# 1206. Design Skiplist

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1206.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1206.html)

**Companies:** eBay, Google, Microsoft, Pure Storage, Twitter

## Description

Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to

add

,

erase

and

search

. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which
        has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively
        short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.

For example: we have a Skiplist containing

[30,40,50,60,70,90]

and we
        want to add

80

and

45

into it. The Skiplist works this
        way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via

Wikimedia
            Commons

You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list.
        With the help of the top layers,

add

,

erase

and

search

can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the
        average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

bool search(int target)

: Return whether the

target

exists in the Skiplist or not.

void add(int num)

: Insert a value into the SkipList.

bool erase(int num)

: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If

num

does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If
            there exists multiple

num

values, removing any one of them is fine.

See more about Skiplist :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();

skiplist.add(1);
skiplist.add(2);
skiplist.add(3);
skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
skiplist.add(4);
skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.
Constraints:
0 <= num, target <= 20000
At most
50000
calls will be made to
search
,
add
, and
erase
.
```

# 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1208.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1208.html)

**Companies:** Traveloka

## Description

You are given two strings

s

and

t

of the same length. You want to
        change

s

to

t

. Changing the

i

-th character of

s

to

i

-th character of

t

costs

|s[i] -
            t[i]|

that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the
        characters.

You are also given an integer

maxCost

.

Return the maximum length of a substring of

s

that can be changed to be the same
        as the corresponding substring of

t

with a cost less than or equal to

maxCost

.

If there is no substring from

s

that can be changed to its corresponding
        substring from

t

, return

0

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3

Output:

3

Explanation:

"abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3

Output:

1

Explanation:

Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in

t, so the maximum length is 1.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0

Output:

1

Explanation:

You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5

0 <= maxCost <= 10^6

s

and

t

only contain lower case English letters.

## Description

Given a string

s

, a

k

duplicate removal

consists
        of choosing

k

adjacent and equal letters from

s

and
        removing them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to
        concatenate together.

We repeatedly make

k

duplicate removals on

s

until we no longer
        can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "abcd", k = 2

# 1210. Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1210.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1210.html)

**Companies:** Kakao

## Description

In an

n*n

grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving
        from the top left corner at

(0, 0)

and

(0, 1)

. The grid has empty
        cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach
        the lower right corner at

(n-1, n-2)

and

(n-1, n-1)

.

In one move the snake can:

Move one cell to the right if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the
            horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.

Move down one cell if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the
            horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.

Rotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are
            both empty. In that case the snake moves from

(r,
                c)

and

(r, c+1)

to

(r, c)

and

(r+1,
                c)

.

Rotate counterclockwise if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its
            right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from

(r, c)

and

(r+1,
                c)

to

(r, c)

and

(r, c+1)

.

Return the minimum number of moves to reach the target.

If there is no way to reach the target, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,0,0,1,0],

# 1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1211.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1211.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

Table:

Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The

position

column has a value from

1

to

500

.
The

rating

column has a value from

1

to

5

. Query with

rating

less than 3 is a poor query.

We define query

quality

as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define

poor query percentage

as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each

query_name

, the

quality

and

poor_query_percentage

.

Both

quality

and

poor_query_percentage

should be

rounded to
        2 decimal places

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+

Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

# 1212. Team Scores in Football Tournament

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1212.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1212.html)

**Companies:** Oracle, Wayfair

## Description

Table:

Teams

+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |
+---------------+----------+
team_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table represents a single football team.

Table:

Matches

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     |
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams.
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the teams table (team_id) and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals respectively.

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as
    follows:

A team receives three points if they win a match (Score strictly more goals
            than the opponent team).

A team receives one point if they draw a match (Same number of goals as the
            opponent team).

A team receives no points if they lose a match (Score less goals than the opponent
            team).

Write an SQL query that selects the

team_id

,

team_name

and

num_points

of each team in the tournament after all described matches.
        Result table should be ordered by

num_points

(decreasing order). In case of
        a tie, order the records by

team_id

(increasing order).

The query result format is in the following example:

Teams

table:
+-----------+--------------+
| team_id   | team_name    |
+-----------+--------------+
| 10        | Leetcode FC  |

# 1222. Queens That Can Attack the King

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1222.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1222.html)

**Companies:** Media.net

## Description

On an

8x8

chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.

Given an array of integer coordinates

queens

that represents the positions of
        the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates

king

that represent the position of
        the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can attack the
        King.

Example 1:

Input:

queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]

Output:

[[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]

Explanation:

The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row.
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column.
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal.
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [0,1].
The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [1,0].
The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same row/column/diagnal as the king.

Example 2:

Input:

queens = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]

Output:

[[2,2],[3,4],[4,4]]

Example 3:

Input:

queens = [[5,6],[7,7],[2,1],[0,7],[1,6],[5,1],[3,7],[0,3],[4,0],[1,2],[6,3],[5,0],[0,4],[2,2],[1,1],[6,4],[5,4],[0,0],[2,6],[4,5],[5,2],[1,4],[7,5],[2,3],[0,5],[4,2],[1,0],[2,7],[0,1],[4,6],[6,1],[0,6],[4,3],[1,7]], king = [3,4]

# 1223. Dice Roll Simulation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1223.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1223.html)

**Companies:** Akuna Capital, Bloomberg, Google

## Description

A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a
        constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number

i

more than

rollMax[i]

(1-indexed)

consecutive

times.

Given an array of integers

rollMax

and an integer

n

,
        return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact

n

rolls.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since
        the answer may be too large, return it modulo

10^9 + 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]

Output:

34

Explanation:

There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]

Output:

30

Example 3:

Input:

n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]

Output:

181

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 5000

rollMax.length == 6

1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15

# 1224. Maximum Equal Frequency

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1224.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1224.html)

**Companies:** American Express

## Description

Given an array

nums

of positive integers, return the longest possible
        length of an array prefix of

nums

, such that it is possible to remove

exactly
            one

element from this prefix so that every number that has appeared in it will
        have the same number of occurrences.

If after removing one element there are no remaining elements, it's still considered that
        every appeared number has the same number of ocurrences (0).

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2,2,1,1,5,3,3,5]

Output:

7

Explanation:

For the subarray [2,2,1,1,5,3,3] of length 7, if we remove nums[4]=5, we will get [2,2,1,1,3,3], so that each number will appear exactly twice.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]

Output:

13

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2]

Output:

5

Example 4:

Input:

nums = [10,2,8,9,3,8,1,5,2,3,7,6]

Output:

8

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^5

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1225.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1225.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

Table:

Failed

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
Primary key for this table is fail_date.
Failed table contains the days of failed tasks.

Table:

Succeeded

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
Primary key for this table is success_date.
Succeeded table contains the days of succeeded tasks.

A system is running one task

every day

. Every task is independent of the
        previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of

period_state

for each continuous
        interval of days in the period from

2019-01-01

to

2019-12-31

.

period_state

is

'failed'

if tasks in this interval failed
        or

'succeeded'

if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days
        are retrieved as

start_date

and

end_date.

Order result by

start_date

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+

Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+


Result table:
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+

The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.
From 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-03 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-05 all tasks failed and system state was "failed".
From 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-06 all tasks succeeded and system state was "succeeded".

# 1226. The Dining Philosophers

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1226.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1226.html)

**Companies:** UnKnown

## Description

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed
        between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat
        spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one
        philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another
        philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both
        forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their
        right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before
        getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite
        supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will
        starve;

i.e.

, each can forever continue to alternate between eating and
        thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

The problem statement and the image above are taken from

wikipedia.org

The philosophers' ids are numbered from

0

to

4

in a

clockwise

order. Implement the function

void
            wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork,
            putRightFork)

where:

philosopher

is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.

pickLeftFork

and

pickRightFork

are functions
            you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.

eat

is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has
            picked both forks.

putLeftFork

and

pickRightFork

are functions you
            can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.

The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the
            function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of
        your class to simulate the process. It is possible that the function will be called for the
        same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 1

Output:

[[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]

Explanation:

n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.
The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
- a is the id of a philosopher.
- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.
- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.

# 1236. Web Crawler

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1236.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1236.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Dropbox, Facebook

## Description

Given a url

startUrl

and an interface

HtmlParser

, implement a web crawler
        to crawl all links that are under the

same hostname

as

startUrl

.

Returns all urls obtained by your web crawler in

any

order.

Your crawler should:

Start from the page:

startUrl

Call

HtmlParser.getUrls(url)

to get all urls from a webpage of given url.

Do not crawl the same link twice.

Only the links that are under the

same hostname

as startUrl should
            be explored by the crawler

As shown in the example url above, the hostname is

example.org

. For simplicity
        sake, you may assume all urls use

http protocol

without
        any

port

specified.

The function interface is defined like this:

interface HtmlParser {

public:

// Returns a list of urls contained in

url

.

public List<String> getUrls(String url);

}

Below there are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing
        purposes you'll have 3 variables

urls

,

edges

and

startUrl

. Notice that you will only have access to

startUrl

, while

urls

and

edges

are secret to you on the rest of the
        testcases.

Example 1:

Input:

urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]
startUrl = "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/"

Output:

[
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]

Example 2:

Input:

urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com"
]
edges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]
startUrl = "http://news.google.com"

Output:

["http://news.google.com"]

Explanation:

The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same hostname.

Constraints:

1 <= urls.length <= 1000

1 <= urls[i].length <= 300

startUrl

is one of the

urls

.

Hostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots, may contain
            only the ASCII letters from 'a' to 'z', digits  from '0'
            to '9' and the hyphen-minus character ('-').

The hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character ('-').

See:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames

You may assume there're no duplicates in url library.

## 1237-find-positive-integer-solution-for-a-given-equation.md

# 1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1237.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1237.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a function

f(x, y)

and a value

z

, return all
        positive integer pairs

x

and

y

where

f(x,y) == z

.

The function is constantly increasing, i.e.:

f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)

f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)

The function interface is defined like this:

interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns positive integer f(x, y) for any given positive integer x and y.
  int f(int x, int y);
};

For custom testing purposes you're given an integer

function_id

and a target

z

as input, where

function_id

represent one function from an
        secret internal list, on the examples you'll know only two functions from the list.

You may return the solutions in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

function_id = 1, z = 5

Output:

[[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]

Explanation:

function_id = 1 means that f(x, y) = x + y

Example 2:

Input:

function_id = 2, z = 5

Output:

[[1,5],[5,1]]

Explanation:

function_id = 2 means that f(x, y) = x * y

Constraints:

1 <= function_id <= 9

1 <= z <= 100

It's guaranteed that the solutions of

f(x, y) == z

will be on the range

1 <= x, y <= 1000

It's also guaranteed that

f(x, y)

will fit in 32 bit signed integer if

1 <= x, y <= 1000

Submissions

+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| sub_id        | int      |
| parent_id     | int      |
+---------------+----------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row can be a post or comment on the post.
parent_id is null for posts.
parent_id for comments is

sub_id

for another post in the table.

Write an SQL query to find number of comments per each post.

Result table should contain

post_id

and its corresponding

number_of_comments

,
        and must be sorted by

post_id

in ascending order.

Submissions

may contain duplicate comments. You should count the number of

unique comments

per post.

Submissions

may contain duplicate posts. You should treat them as one post.

The query result format is in the following example:

Submissions table:
+---------+------------+
| sub_id  | parent_id  |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Null       |
| 2       | Null       |
| 1       | Null       |
| 12      | Null       |
| 3       | 1          |
| 5       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 4       | 1          |
| 9       | 1          |
| 10      | 2          |
| 6       | 7          |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+---------+--------------------+
| post_id | number_of_comments |
+---------+--------------------+
| 1       | 3                  |
| 2       | 2                  |
| 12      | 0                  |
+---------+--------------------+

The post with id 1 has three comments in the table with id 3, 4 and 9. The comment with id 3 is repeated in the table, we counted it

only once

.
The post with id 2 has two comments in the table with id 5 and 10.

# 1242. Web Crawler Multithreaded

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1242.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1242.html)

**Companies:** Dropbox, Facebook

## Description

Given a url

startUrl

and an interface

HtmlParser

, implement

a Multi-threaded web crawler

to crawl all links that are under the

same
            hostname

as

startUrl

.

Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in

any

order.

Your crawler should:

Start from the page:

startUrl

Call

HtmlParser.getUrls(url)

to get all urls from a webpage of given url.

Do not crawl the same link twice.

Explore only the links that are under the

same hostname

as

startUrl

.

As shown in the example url above, the hostname is

example.org

. For simplicity
        sake, you may assume all urls use

http protocol

without
        any

port

specified. For example, the urls

http://leetcode.com/problems

and

http://leetcode.com/contest

are under the same hostname, while urls

http://example.org/test

and

http://example.com/abc

are not under
        the same hostname.

The

HtmlParser

interface is defined as such:

interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given

url

.
  // This is a blocking call, that means it will do HTTP request and return when this request is finished.
  public List<String> getUrls(String url);
}

Note that

getUrls(String url)

simulates performing a HTTP
        request. You can treat it as a blocking function call which waits for a HTTP request to
        finish. It is guaranteed that

getUrls(String url)

will return the urls
        within

15ms.

Single-threaded solutions will exceed the time limit so,
        can your multi-threaded web crawler do better?

Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing
        purposes you'll have three variables

urls

,

edges

and

startUrl

. Notice that you will only have access to

startUrl

in your code, while

urls

and

edges

are not directly accessible to you in
        code.

Follow up:

Assume we have 10,000 nodes and 1 billion URLs to crawl. We will deploy the same
            software onto each node. The software can know about all the nodes. We have to
            minimize communication between machines and make sure each node does equal amount of
            work. How would your web crawler design change?

What if one node fails or does not work?

How do you know when the crawler is done?

Example 1:

Input:

urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]
startUrl = "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/"

Output:

[
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]

Example 2:

Input:

urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com"
]
edges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]
startUrl = "http://news.google.com"

Output:

["http://news.google.com"]

Explanation:

The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same hostname.

Constraints:

1 <= urls.length <= 1000

1 <= urls[i].length <= 300

startUrl

is one of the

urls

.

Hostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots, may contain
            only the ASCII letters from 'a' to 'z', digits from '0' to
            '9' and the hyphen-minus character ('-').

The hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character ('-').

# 1243. Array Transformation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1243.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1243.html)

**Companies:** Virtu Financial

## Description

Given an initial array

arr

, every day you produce a new array using the array of
        the previous day.

On the

i

-th day, you do the following operations on the array of day

i-1

to
        produce the array of day

i

:

If an element is smaller than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor, then this
            element is incremented.

If an element is bigger than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor, then this
            element is decremented.

The first and last elements never change.

After some days, the array does not change. Return that final array.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [6,2,3,4]

Output:

[6,3,3,4]

Explanation:

On the first day, the array is changed from [6,2,3,4] to [6,3,3,4].
No more operations can be done to this array.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,6,3,4,3,5]

Output:

[1,4,4,4,4,5]

Explanation:

On the first day, the array is changed from [1,6,3,4,3,5] to [1,5,4,3,4,5].
On the second day, the array is changed from [1,5,4,3,4,5] to [1,4,4,4,4,5].
No more operations can be done to this array.

# 1247. Minimum Swaps to Make Strings Equal

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1247.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1247.html)

## Description

You are given two strings

s1

and

s2

of equal
        length consisting of letters

"x"

and

"y"

only

. Your task is to make these two strings equal to each other. You
        can swap any two characters that belong to

different

strings, which
        means: swap

s1[i]

and

s2[j]

.

Return the minimum number of swaps required to make

s1

and

s2

equal, or return

-1

if it is impossible to do
        so.

Example 1:

Input:

s1 = "xx", s2 = "yy"

Output:

1

Explanation:

Swap s1[0] and s2[1], s1 = "yx", s2 = "yx".

Example 2:

Input:

s1 = "xy", s2 = "yx"

Output:

2

Explanation:

Swap s1[0] and s2[0], s1 = "yy", s2 = "xx".
Swap s1[0] and s2[1], s1 = "xy", s2 = "xy".
Note that you can't swap s1[0] and s1[1] to make s1 equal to "yx", cause we can only swap chars in different strings.

Example 3:

Input:

s1 = "xx", s2 = "xy"

Output:

-1

Example 4:

Input:

s1 = "xxyyxyxyxx", s2 = "xyyxyxxxyx"

Output:

4

Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000

s1, s2

only contain

'x'

or

'y'

.

+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.

| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units and product_id of each product sold.

Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product.

average_price

should be

# 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1261.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1261.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a binary tree with the following rules:

root.val == 0

If

treeNode.val == x

and

treeNode.left != null

, then

treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1

If

treeNode.val == x

and

treeNode.right != null

, then

treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2

Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all

treeNode.val

have been
                changed to

-1

.

You need to first recover the binary tree and then implement the

FindElements

class:

FindElements(TreeNode* root)

Initializes the object with a contamined
                    binary tree, you need to recover it first.

bool find(int target)

Return if the

target

value
                    exists in the recovered binary tree.

Example 1:

Input

["FindElements","find","find"]
[[[-1,null,-1]],[1],[2]]

Output

[null,false,true]

Explanation

FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,null,-1]);
findElements.find(1); // return False
findElements.find(2); // return True

Example 2:

Input

["FindElements","find","find","find"]
[[[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]],[1],[3],[5]]

Output

[null,true,true,false]

Explanation

FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]);
findElements.find(1); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return True
findElements.find(5); // return False

Example 3:

Input

["FindElements","find","find","find","find"]
[[[-1,null,-1,-1,null,-1]],[2],[3],[4],[5]]

Output

[null,true,false,false,true]

Explanation

FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,null,-1,-1,null,-1]);
findElements.find(2); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return False
findElements.find(4); // return False
findElements.find(5); // return True

Constraints:

TreeNode.val == -1

The height of the binary tree is less than or equal to

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1263.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1263.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a
            warehouse trying to get them to target locations.

The game is represented by a

grid

of size

m x n

, where
                each element is a wall, floor, or a box.

Your task is move the box

'B'

to the target position

'T'

under the following rules:

Player is represented by character

'S'

and can move up,
                    down, left, right in the

grid

if it is a floor (empy cell).

Floor is represented by character

'.'

that means free cell to walk.

Wall is represented by character

'#'

that means obstacle  (impossible
                    to walk there).

There is only one box

'B'

and one target cell

'T'

in the

grid

.

The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and
                    then moving in the direction of the box. This is a

push

.

The player cannot walk through the box.

Return the minimum number of

pushes

to move the box to the target.
                If there is no way to reach the target, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.

Write an SQL query to find

employee_id

of all employees that
                directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers as the company is
                small.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employees

+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |

# 1274. Number of Ships in a Rectangle

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1274.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1274.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg

## Description

(This problem is an

interactive problem

.)

On the sea represented by a cartesian plane, each ship is located at an integer
                point, and each integer point may contain at most 1 ship.

You have a function

Sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft)

which takes two
                points as arguments and returns

true

if and only if there is
                at least one ship in the rectangle represented by the two points, including on the
                boundary.

Given two points, which are the top right and bottom left corners of a rectangle,
                return the number of ships present in that rectangle.  It is guaranteed
                that there are

at most 10 ships

in that rectangle.

## Description

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players

A

and

B

on
            a

3

x

3

grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").

The first player

A

always places "X" characters, while the second
                    player

B

always places "O" characters.

"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled
                    ones.

The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any
                    row, column, or diagonal.

The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.

No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given an array

moves

where each element is another array of size 2
                corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective
                character in the order in which

A

and

B

play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (

A

or

B

), in case the
                game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return
                "Pending".

You can assume that

Example 2:

Input:

moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:

"B"

Explanation:

"B" wins.
"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XX

## 1279-traffic-light-controlled-intersection.md

# 1279. Traffic Light Controlled Intersection

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1279.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1279.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Unknown

## Description

There is an intersection of two roads. First road is road A where cars travel from
            North to South in direction 1 and from South to North in direction 2. Second road is
            road B where cars travel from West to East in direction 3 and from East to West in
            direction 4.

There is a traffic light located on each road before the intersection. A traffic
                light can either be green or red.

Green

means cars can cross the intersection in both
                    directions of the road.

Red

means cars in both directions cannot cross the intersection
                    and must wait until the light turns green.

The traffic lights cannot be green on both roads at the same time. That means when
                the light is green on road A, it is red on road B and when the light is green
                on road B, it is red on road A.

Initially, the traffic light is

green

on road A and

red

on road B. When the light is green on one road, all cars
                can cross the intersection in both directions until the light becomes green on the
                other road. No two cars traveling on different roads should cross at the same
                time.

Design a deadlock-free traffic light controlled system at this intersection.

Implement the function

void carArrived(carId, roadId, direction,
                turnGreen, crossCar)

where:

carId

is the id of the car that arrived.

roadId

is the id of the road that the car travels on.

direction

is the direction of the car.

turnGreen

is a function you can call to turn the traffic light
                    to green on the current road.

crossCar

is a function you can call to let the current car
                    cross the intersection.

Your answer is considered correct if it avoids cars deadlock in the intersection. Turning
                the light green on a road when it was already green is considered a wrong
                answer.

Example 1:

Input:

cars = [1,3,5,2,4], directions = [2,1,2,4,3], arrivalTimes = [10,20,30,40,50]

Output:

[
"Car 1 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2",    // Traffic light on road A is green, car 1 can cross the intersection.
"Car 3 Has Passed Road A In Direction 1",    // Car 3 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.
"Car 5 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2",    // Car 5 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.
"Traffic Light On Road B Is Green",          // Car 2 requests green light for road B.
"Car 2 Has Passed Road B In Direction 4",    // Car 2 crosses as the light is green on road B now.
"Car 4 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3"     // Car 4 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.
]

Example 2:

Input:

cars = [1,2,3,4,5], directions = [2,4,3,3,1], arrivalTimes = [10,20,30,40,40]

Output:

[
"Car 1 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2",    // Traffic light on road A is green, car 1 can cross the intersection.
"Traffic Light On Road B Is Green",          // Car 2 requests green light for road B.
"Car 2 Has Passed Road B In Direction 4",    // Car 2 crosses as the light is green on road B now.
"Car 3 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3",    // Car 3 crosses as the light is green on road B now.
"Traffic Light On Road A Is Green",          // Car 5 requests green light for road A.
"Car 5 Has Passed Road A In Direction 1",    // Car 5 crosses as the light is green on road A now.
"Traffic Light On Road B Is Green",          // Car 4 requests green light for road B. Car 4 blocked until car 5 crosses and then traffic light is green on road B.
"Car 4 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3"     // Car 4 crosses as the light is green on road B now.
]

Explanation:

This is a dead-lock free scenario. Note that the scenario when car 4 crosses before turning light into green on road A and allowing car 5 to pass is also

correct

and

Accepted

scenario.

Constraints:

1 <= cars.length <= 20

cars.length = directions.length

cars.length = arrivalTimes.length

All values of

cars

are unique

1 <= directions[i] <= 4

arrivalTimes

is non-decreasing

## 1283-find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold.md

# 1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1283.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1283.html)

**Companies:** Expedia, Salesforce

## Description

Given an array of integers

nums

and an integer

threshold

,
            we will choose a positive integer divisor and divide all the array by it and
            sum the result of the division. Find the

smallest

divisor such that the
            result mentioned above is less than or equal to

threshold

.

Each result of division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than
                or equal to that element. (For example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5).

It is guaranteed that there will be an answer.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6

Output:

5

Explanation:

We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1.
If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum to 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2).

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2,3,5,7,11], threshold = 11

Output:

3

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [19], threshold = 5

**Companies:** Airbnb, Google

## Description

Given a

m x n

binary matrix

mat

. In one step, you can
            choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbours of it if they exist (Flip
            is changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighboors if they share one
            edge.

Return the

minimum number of steps

required to convert

mat

to
                a zero matrix or

-1

if you cannot.

# 1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1298.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1298.html)

**Companies:** Airbnb

## Description

Given

n

boxes, each box is given in the format

[status, candies,
            keys, containedBoxes]

where:

status[i]

: an integer which is

1

if

box[i]

is open and

0

if

box[i]

is closed.

candies[i]

: an integer representing the number of candies in

box[i]

.

keys[i]

: an array contains the indices of the boxes you can open
                    with the key in

box[i]

.

containedBoxes[i]

: an array contains the indices of the boxes found
                    in

box[i]

.

You will start with some boxes given in

initialBoxes

array. You can take
                all the candies in any open box and you can use the keys in it to open new
                boxes and you also can use the boxes you find in it.

Return

the maximum number of candies

you can get following the rules above.

Example 1:

Input:

status = [1,0,1,0], candies = [7,5,4,100], keys = [[],[],[1],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]

Output:

16

Explanation:

You will be initially given box 0. You will find 7 candies in it and boxes 1 and 2. Box 1 is closed and you don't have a key for it so you will open box 2. You will find 4 candies and a key to box 1 in box 2.
In box 1, you will find 5 candies and box 3 but you will not find a key to box 3 so box 3 will remain closed.
Total number of candies collected = 7 + 4 + 5 = 16 candy.

Example 2:

Input:

status = [1,0,0,0,0,0], candies = [1,1,1,1,1,1], keys = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]

Output:

6

Explanation:

You have initially box 0. Opening it you can find boxes 1,2,3,4 and 5 and their keys. The total number of candies will be 6.

Example 3:

Input:

status = [1,1,1], candies = [100,1,100], keys = [[],[0,2],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [1]

Output:

1

Example 4:

Input:

status = [1], candies = [100], keys = [[]], containedBoxes = [[]], initialBoxes = []

Output:

0

Example 5:

Input:

status = [1,1,1], candies = [2,3,2], keys = [[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [2,1,0]

Output:

7

Constraints:

1 <= status.length <= 1000

## Description

Given an array of non-negative integers

arr

, you are initially
            positioned at

start

index of the array. When you are at index

i

, you can jump to

i + arr[i]

or

i - arr[i]

,
            check if you can reach to

any

index with value 0.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5

Output:

true

Explanation:

All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are:
index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3
index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0

Output:

true

Explanation:

One possible way to reach at index 3 with value 0 is:
index 0 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2

Output:

false

Explanation:

There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.

**Companies:** Atlassian

## Description

Given an equation, represented by

words

on left side and the

result

on right side.

You need to check if the equation is solvable under the following rules:

Each character is decoded as one digit (0 - 9).

Every pair of different characters they must map to different digits.

Each

words[i]

and

result

are decoded as one
                    number

without

leading zeros.

Sum of numbers on left side (

words

) will equal to the number on
                    right side (

result

).

Return

True

if the equation is solvable otherwise return

False

.

Example 1:

Input:

words = ["SEND","MORE"], result = "MONEY"

Output:

true

Explanation:

Map 'S'-> 9, 'E'->5, 'N'->6, 'D'->7, 'M'->1, 'O'->0, 'R'->8, 'Y'->'2'
Such that: "SEND" + "MORE" = "MONEY" ,  9567 + 1085 = 10652

Example 2:

Input:

words = ["SIX","SEVEN","SEVEN"], result = "TWENTY"

Output:

true

Explanation:

Map 'S'-> 6, 'I'->5, 'X'->0, 'E'->8, 'V'->7, 'N'->2, 'T'->1, 'W'->'3', 'Y'->4
Such that: "SIX" + "SEVEN" + "SEVEN" = "TWENTY" ,  650 + 68782 + 68782 = 138214

# 1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1320.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1320.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the XY plane, where each English
                uppercase letter is located at some coordinate, for example, the letter

A

is located at coordinate

(0,0)

, the letter

B

is located at coordinate

(0,1)

, the letter

P

is located at coordinate

(2,3)

and the letter

Z

is located at coordinate

(4,1)

.

Given the string

word

, return the minimum total distance to type such
                string using only two fingers. The distance between coordinates

(x

1

,y

1

)

and

(x

2

,y

2

)

is

|x

1

-
                    x

2

| + |y

1

- y

2

|

.

Note that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so don't
                count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to start
                at the first letter or the first two letters.

Example 1:

Input:

word = "CAKE"

Output:

3

Explanation:

Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "CAKE" is:
Finger 1 on letter 'C' -> cost = 0
Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'C' to letter 'A' = 2
Finger 2 on letter 'K' -> cost = 0
Finger 2 on letter 'E' -> cost = Distance from letter 'K' to letter 'E' = 1
Total distance = 3

Example 2:

Input:

word = "HAPPY"

Output:

6

Explanation:

Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "HAPPY" is:
Finger 1 on letter 'H' -> cost = 0
Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'H' to letter 'A' = 2
Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = 0
Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = Distance from letter 'P' to letter 'P' = 0
Finger 1 on letter 'Y' -> cost = Distance from letter 'A' to letter 'Y' = 4
Total distance = 6

Example 3:

Input:

word = "NEW"

Output:

3

Example 4:

Input:

word = "YEAR"

Output:

7

Constraints:

2 <= word.length <= 300

Each

word[i]

is an English
                    uppercase letter.

| user_id       | int     |
| action        | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
(ad_id, user_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of an Ad, the ID of a user and the action taken by this user regarding this Ad.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('Clicked', 'Viewed', 'Ignored').

A company is running Ads and wants to calculate the performance of each Ad.

Performance of the Ad is measured using Click-Through Rate (CTR) where:

Write an SQL query to find the

ctr

of each Ad.

Round

ctr

to 2 decimal points.

Order

the result table by

ctr

in descending order and
                by

ad_id

in ascending order in case of a tie.

The query result format is in the following example:

Ads table:
+-------+---------+---------+
| ad_id | user_id | action  |
+-------+---------+---------+
| 1     | 1       | Clicked |

## Description

Given an array of integers

arr

, replace each element with its
            rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:

Rank is an integer starting from 1.

The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their
                    rank must be the same.

Rank should be as small as possible.

## 1333-filter-restaurants-by-vegan-friendly-price-and-distance.md

# 1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1333.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1333.html)

**Companies:** Yelp

## Description

Given the array

restaurants

where

restaurants[i] = [id

i

,
            rating

i

, veganFriendly

i

, price

i

, distance

i

]

.
            You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The

veganFriendly

filter will be either

true

(meaning you
                should only include restaurants with

veganFriendly

i

set to
                true) or

false

(meaning you can include any restaurant). In
                addition, you have the filters

maxPrice

and

maxDistance

which are the maximum value for price and
                distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant

IDs

after filtering, ordered
                by

rating

from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same
                rating, order them by

id

from highest to lowest. For
                simplicity

veganFriendly

i

and

veganFriendly

take value

1

when it is

true

, and

0

when it is

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10

Output:

[3,1,5]

Explanation:

The restaurants are:
Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1]
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest).

Example 2:

Input:

restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10

Output:

[4,3,2,1,5]

Explanation:

The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.

Example 3:

Input:

restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3

Output:

[4,5]

Constraints:

1 <= restaurants.length <= 10^4

restaurants[i].length == 5

1 <= id

i

, rating

i

, price

i

,
                    distance

# 1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1334.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1334.html)

**Companies:** Uber

## Description

There are

n

cities numbered from

0

to

n-1

.
            Given the array

edges

where

edges[i] = [from

i

,
                to

i

, weight

i

]

represents a bidirectional and weighted
            edge between cities

from

i

and

to

i

,
            and given the integer

distanceThreshold

.

Return the city with the smallest number

of cities that are
                reachable through some path and whose distance is

at most

distanceThreshold

,
                If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities

i

and

j

is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that
                path.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4

Output:

3

Explanation:

The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2

Output:

0

Explanation:

The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100

1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2

edges[i].length == 3

0 <= from

i

< to

i

< n

1 <= weight

i

, distanceThreshold <= 10^4

# 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1335.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1335.html)

**Companies:** Turvo

## Description

You want to schedule a list of jobs in

d

days. Jobs are dependent (i.e
            To work on the

i-th

job, you have to finish all the jobs

j

where

0 <= j < i

).

You have to finish

at least

one task every day. The difficulty of a
                job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the

d

days. The
                difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers

jobDifficulty

and an integer

d

.
                The difficulty of the

i-th

job
                is

jobDifficulty[i]

.

Return

the minimum difficulty

of a job schedule. If you cannot find a
                schedule for the jobs return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2

Output:

7

Explanation:

First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7

Example 2:

Input:

jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4

Output:

# 1336. Number of Transactions per Visit

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1336.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1336.html)

**Companies:** Machine Zone, MachineZone, Unknown

## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

Visits

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, visit_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has visited the bank in visit_date.

Table:

Transactions

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| user_id          | int     |
| transaction_date | date    |
| amount           | int     |
+------------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has done a transaction of amount in transaction_date.
It is guaranteed that the user has visited the bank in the transaction_date.(i.e The Visits table contains (user_id, transaction_date) in one row)

A bank wants to draw a chart of the number of transactions bank visitors did in one
                visit to the bank and the corresponding number of visitors who have done this number
                of transaction in one visit.

Write an SQL query to find how many users visited the bank and didn't do any
                transactions, how many visited the bank and did one transaction and so on.

The result table will contain two columns:

transactions_count

which is the number of transactions done in one
                    visit.

visits_count

which is the corresponding number of users who
                    did

transactions_count

in one visit to the bank.

transactions_count

should take all values from

0

to

max(transactions_count)

done by one or more users.

Order the result table by

transactions_count

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Visits

table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | visit_date |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2020-01-01 |
| 2       | 2020-01-02 |

## Description

Given a

m * n

matrix

mat

of

ones

(representing
            soldiers) and

zeros

(representing civilians), return the indexes of the

k

weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row

i

is weaker than row

j

, if
                the number of soldiers in row

i

is less than the number of
                soldiers in row

j

, or they have the same number of
                soldiers but

i

is less than

j

.
                Soldiers are

always

stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always

ones

may appear first and then

zeros

.

 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]],
k = 3

Output:

[2,0,3]

Explanation:

The number of soldiers for each row is:
row 0 -> 2

# 1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1338.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1338.html)

**Companies:** Akuna Capital

## Description

Given an array

arr

.  You can choose a set of integers and remove
            all the occurrences of these integers in the array.

Return

the minimum size of the set

so that

at least

half of
                the integers of the array are removed.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]

Output:

2

Explanation:

Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has size greater than half of the size of the old array.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]

Output:

1

Explanation:

The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new array empty.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [1,9]

Output:

1

Example 4:

Input:

arr = [1000,1000,3,7]

Output:

1

Example 5:

Input:

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Output:

# 1340. Jump Game V

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1340.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1340.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given an array of integers

arr

and an integer

d

. In
            one step you can jump from index

i

to index:

i + x

where:

i + x < arr.length

and

0
                    < x <= d

.

i - x

where:

i - x >= 0

and

0 < x
                    <= d

.

In addition, you can only jump from index

i

to index

j

if

arr[i] > arr[j]

and

arr[i] > arr[k]

for all indices

k

between

i

and

j

(More formally

min(i, j)
                    < k < max(i, j)

).

You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return

the maximum
                number of indices

you can visit.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2

Output:

4

Explanation:

You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [3,3,3,3,3], d = 3

Output:

1

Explanation:

You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.

Example 3:

# 1348. Tweet Counts Per Frequency

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1348.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1348.html)

**Companies:** Twitter

## Description

Implement the class

TweetCounts

that supports two methods:

1.

recordTweet(string tweetName, int time)

Stores the

tweetName

at the recorded

time

(in

seconds

).

2.

getTweetCountsPerFrequency(string freq, string tweetName, int startTime, int
                endTime)

Returns the total number of occurrences for the given

tweetName

per

minute

,

hour

, or

day

(depending on

freq

) starting from the

startTime

(in

seconds

) and ending at the

endTime

(in

seconds

).

freq

is always

minute

,

hour

or

day

, representing the time interval to get the total
                    number of occurrences for the given

tweetName

.

The first time interval always starts from the

startTime

, so the
                    time intervals are

[startTime, startTime + delta*1>,  [startTime +
                        delta*1, startTime + delta*2>, [startTime + delta*2, startTime + delta*3>,
                        ... , [startTime + delta*i,

min

(startTime + delta*(i+1),
                        endTime + 1)>

for some non-negative number

i

and

delta

(which depends on

freq

).

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input
["TweetCounts","recordTweet","recordTweet","recordTweet","getTweetCountsPerFrequency","getTweetCountsPerFrequency","recordTweet","getTweetCountsPerFrequency"]
[[],["tweet3",0],["tweet3",60],["tweet3",10],["minute","tweet3",0,59],["minute","tweet3",0,60],["tweet3",120],["hour","tweet3",0,210]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,[2],[2,1],null,[4]]
Explanation
TweetCounts tweetCounts = new TweetCounts();
tweetCounts.recordTweet("tweet3", 0);
tweetCounts.recordTweet("tweet3", 60);
tweetCounts.recordTweet("tweet3", 10);                             // All tweets correspond to "tweet3" with recorded times at 0, 10 and 60.
tweetCounts.getTweetCountsPerFrequency("minute", "tweet3", 0, 59); // return [2]. The frequency is per minute (60 seconds), so there is one interval of time: 1) [0, 60> - > 2 tweets.
tweetCounts.getTweetCountsPerFrequency("minute", "tweet3", 0, 60); // return [2, 1]. The frequency is per minute (60 seconds), so there are two intervals of time: 1) [0, 60> - > 2 tweets, and 2) [60,61> - > 1 tweet.
tweetCounts.recordTweet("tweet3", 120);                            // All tweets correspond to "tweet3" with recorded times at 0, 10, 60 and 120.
tweetCounts.getTweetCountsPerFrequency("hour", "tweet3", 0, 210);  // return [4]. The frequency is per hour (3600 seconds), so there is one interval of time: 1) [0, 211> - > 4 tweets.
Constraints:
There will be at most
10000
operations considering both
recordTweet
and
getTweetCountsPerFrequency
.
0 <= time, startTime, endTime <= 10^9
0 <= endTime - startTime <= 10^4

## Description

Given an integer array

arr

. You have to sort the integers in the array in
            ascending order by the number of

1's

in their binary
            representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of

1's

you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return

the sorted array

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

Output:

[0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

There is a sale in a supermarket, there will be a

discount

every

n

customer.

There are some products in the supermarket where the id of the

i-th

product
            is

products[i]

and the price per unit of this product is

prices[i]

.

The system will count the number of customers and when the

n-th

customer
            arrive he/she will have a

discount

on the bill. (i.e if the cost is

x

the new cost is

x - (discount * x) / 100

). Then the system
            will start counting customers again.

The customer orders a certain amount of each product where

product[i]

is
            the id of the

i-th

product the customer ordered and

amount[i]

is the number of units the customer ordered of that product.

Implement the

Cashier

class:

Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices)

Initializes the object with

n

, the

discount

, the

products

and their

prices

.

double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount)

returns the
                    value of the bill and apply the discount if needed. Answers within

10^-5

of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

## Description

Given

n

orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services.

Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always
                after of pickup(i).

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 2

Output:

6

Explanation:

All possible orders:
(P1,P2,D1,D2), (P1,P2,D2,D1), (P1,D1,P2,D2), (P2,P1,D1,D2), (P2,P1,D2,D1) and (P2,D2,P1,D1).
This is an invalid order (P1,D2,P2,D1) because Pickup 2 is after of Delivery 2.

## 1366-rank-teams-by-votes.md

# 1366. Rank Teams by Votes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1366.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1366.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to
            all teams participated in the competition.

The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two
                or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve
                the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are
                resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we
                rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.

Given an array of strings

votes

which is the votes of all voters in the
                ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.

Return

a string of all teams

sorted

by the ranking system.

Example 1:

Input:

votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]

Output:

"ACB"

Explanation:

Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.
As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.

Example 2:

Input:

votes = ["WXYZ","XYZW"]

Output:

"XWYZ"

Explanation:

X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't have any votes as second position.

Example 3:

Input:

votes = ["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"]

Output:

"ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"

Explanation:

Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.

Example 4:

Input:

votes = ["BCA","CAB","CBA","ABC","ACB","BAC"]

Output:

"ABC"

Explanation:

Team A was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
Team B was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
Team C was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters and third by 2 voters.
There is a tie and we rank teams ascending by their IDs.

Example 5:

Input:

votes = ["M","M","M","M"]

Output:

"M"

Explanation:

Only team M in the competition so it has the first rank.

Constraints:

1 <= votes.length <= 1000

1 <= votes[i].length <= 26

votes[i].length == votes[j].length

for

0 <= i, j
                    < votes.length

.

votes[i][j]

is an English

upper-case

letter.

All characters of

votes[i]

are unique.

All the characters that occur in

votes[0]

also occur

in

votes[j]

where

1 <= j < votes.length

Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the

head

correspond to some

downward path

connected in the binary
                tree otherwise return False.

In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes
                downwards.

## 1368-minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid.md

# 1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1368.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1368.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a

m

x

n

grid

. Each cell of the

grid

has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell.
            The sign of

grid[i][j]

can be:

1

which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from

grid[i][j]

to

grid[i][j + 1]

)

2

which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from

grid[i][j]

to

grid[i][j - 1]

)

3

which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from

grid[i][j]

to

grid[i + 1][j]

)

4

which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from

grid[i][j]

to

grid[i - 1][j]

)

Notice that there could be some

invalid signs

on the cells of
                the

grid

which points outside the

grid

.

You will initially start at the upper left cell

(0,0)

. A valid path in
                the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell

(0,0)

and
                ends at the bottom-right cell

(m - 1, n - 1)

following the signs
                on the grid. The valid path

doesn't have to be the shortest

.

You can modify the sign on a cell with

cost = 1

. You can modify the sign
                on a cell

one time only

.

Return

the minimum cost

to make the grid have at least one valid path.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

You will start at point (0, 0).
The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
The total cost = 3.

Example 2:

Input:

grid = [[1,1,3],[3,2,2],[1,1,4]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

You can follow the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

Example 3:

Input:

grid = [[1,2],[4,3]]

Output:

1

Example 4:

Input:

grid = [[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]

Output:

3

Example 5:

## 1377-frog-position-after-t-seconds.md

# 1377. Frog Position After T Seconds

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1377.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1377.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an undirected tree consisting of

n

vertices numbered from 1
            to

n

. A frog starts jumping from the

vertex 1

. In one
            second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another

unvisited

vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In
            case the frog can jump to several vertices it jumps randomly to one of them with the
            same probability, otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex it jumps
            forever on the same vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array

edges

,
                where

edges[i] = [from

i

, to

i

]

means that exists
                an edge connecting directly the vertices

from

i

and

to

i

.

Return the probability that after

t

seconds the frog is on the
                vertex

target

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4

Output:

0.16666666666666666

Explanation:

The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after

second 1

and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after

second 2

. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666.

Example 2:

Input:

## Description

Design a stack which supports the following operations.

Implement the

CustomStack

class:

CustomStack(int maxSize)

Initializes the object with

maxSize

which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do
                    nothing if the stack reached the

maxSize

# 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1383.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1383.html)

**Companies:** Citrix

## Description

There are

n

engineers numbered from 1 to

n

and two
            arrays:

speed

and

efficiency

, where

speed[i]

and

efficiency[i]

represent the speed and efficiency for the i-th engineer
            respectively.

Return the maximum

performance

of a team composed of at
                most

k

engineers, since the answer can be a huge number,
                return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

The

performance

of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds
                multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2

Output:

60

Explanation:

We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3

Output:

68

Explanation:

This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4

Output:

72

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

speed.length == n

efficiency.length == n

1 <= speed[i] <= 10^5

1 <= efficiency[i] <= 10^8

# 1386. Cinema Seat Allocation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1386.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1386.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

A cinema has

n

rows of seats, numbered from 1 to

n

and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to
                10 as shown in the figure above.

Given the array

reservedSeats

containing the numbers of seats already
                reserved, for example,

reservedSeats[i]=[3,8]

means the seat
                located in row

3

and labelled with

8

is already
                reserved.

Return the maximum number of four-person families you can allocate on the cinema seats.

A four-person family occupies fours seats

in one row

, that are

next to each other

. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and
                [3,4]) are not considered to be next to each other, however, It is permissible for
                the four-person family to be separated by an aisle, but in that case,

exactly
                    two people

have to sit on each side of the aisle.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]

Output:

4

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1387.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1387.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

The power of an integer

x

is defined as the number of steps needed to
            transform

x

into

1

using the following steps:

if

x

is even then

x = x / 2

if

x

is odd then

x = 3 * x + 1

For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1 (3 --> 10
                --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1).

Given three integers

lo

,

hi

and

k

. The task is
                to sort all integers in the interval

[lo, hi]

by the power value in

ascending order

, if two or more integers have

the
                    same

power value sort them by

ascending order

.

Return the

k-th

integer in the range

[lo, hi]

sorted by the
                power value.

Notice that for any integer

x

(lo <= x <= hi)

it
                is

guaranteed

that

x

will transform into

1

using these steps and that the power of

x

is will

fit

in 32 bit signed integer.

Example 1:

Input:

lo = 12, hi = 15, k = 2

Output:

13

Explanation:

The power of 12 is 9 (12 --> 6 --> 3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1)
The power of 13 is 9
The power of 14 is 17
The power of 15 is 17
The interval sorted by the power value [12,13,14,15]. For k = 2 answer is the second element which is 13.
Notice that 12 and 13 have the same power value and we sorted them in ascending order. Same for 14 and 15.

Example 2:

Input:

lo = 1, hi = 1, k = 1

Output:

1

Example 3:

Input:

lo = 7, hi = 11, k = 4

Output:

7

Explanation:

The power array corresponding to the interval [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] is [16, 3, 19, 6, 14].
The interval sorted by power is [8, 10, 11, 7, 9].
The fourth number in the sorted array is 7.

Example 4:

Input:

lo = 10, hi = 20, k = 5

Output:

13

Example 5:

Input:

lo = 1, hi = 1000, k = 777

Output:

570

Constraints:

1 <= lo <= hi <= 1000

1 <= k <= hi - lo + 1

Table:

Stocks

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(stock_name, day) is the primary key for this table.
The operation column is an ENUM of type ('Sell', 'Buy')
Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day.

Write an SQL query to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.

The capital gain/loss of a stock is total gain or loss after buying and selling the
                stock one or many times.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Stocks

table:
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| stock_name    | operation | operation_day | price  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |

| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

# 1396. Design Underground System

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1396.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1396.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg

## Description

Implement the class

UndergroundSystem

that supports three methods:

1.

checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)

A customer with id card equal to

id

, gets in the station

stationName

at time

t

.

A customer can only be checked into one place at a time.

2.

checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)

A customer with id card equal to

id

, gets out from the station

stationName

at time

t

.

3.

getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)

Returns the average time to travel between the

startStation

and the

endStation

.

The average time is computed from all the previous traveling from

startStation

to

endStation

that happened

directly

.

Call to

getAverageTime

is always valid.

You can assume all calls to

checkIn

and

checkOut

methods
                are consistent. That is, if a customer gets in at time

t

1

at some station, then it gets out at time

t

2

with

t

2

>
                    t

1

. All events happen in chronological order.

Example 1:

undergroundSystem.checkOut(27, "Waterloo", 20);
undergroundSystem.checkOut(32, "Cambridge", 22);
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Paradise", "Cambridge");       // return 14.0. There was only one travel from "Paradise" (at time 8) to "Cambridge" (at time 22)
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Leyton", "Waterloo");          // return 11.0. There were two travels from "Leyton" to "Waterloo", a customer with id=45 from time=3 to time=15 and a customer with id=27 from time=10 to time=20. So the average time is ( (15-3) + (20-10) ) / 2 = 11.0
undergroundSystem.checkIn(10, "Leyton", 24);
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Leyton", "Waterloo");          // return 11.0
undergroundSystem.checkOut(10, "Waterloo", 38);
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Leyton", "Waterloo");          // return 12.0

Given the strings

s1

and

s2

of size

n

, and
            the string

evil

.

Return the number of

good

strings

.

A

good

string has size

n

, it is alphabetically greater
                than or equal to

s1

, it is alphabetically smaller than or equal to

s2

, and it does not contain the string

evil

as a
                substring. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 2, s1 = "aa", s2 = "da", evil = "b"

Output:

51

Explanation:

There are 25 good strings starting with 'a': "aa","ac","ad",...,"az". Then there are 25 good strings starting with 'c': "ca","cc","cd",...,"cz" and finally there is one good string starting with 'd': "da".

Example 2:

Input:

n = 8, s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "leetgoes", evil = "leet"

Output:

0

Explanation:

All strings greater than or equal to s1 and smaller than or equal to s2 start with the prefix "leet", therefore, there is not any good string.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 2, s1 = "gx", s2 = "gz", evil = "x"

Output:

2

Constraints:

s1.length == n

s2.length == n

1 <= n <= 500

1 <= evil.length <= 50

All strings consist of lowercase English letters.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1400.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1400.html)

**Companies:** Uber

## Description

Given a string

s

and an integer

k

. You should construct

k

non-empty

palindrome

strings using

all the
                characters

in

s

.

Return

True

if you can use all the characters in

s

to construct

k

palindrome strings or

False

otherwise.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "annabelle", k = 2

Output:

true

Explanation:

You can construct two palindromes using all characters in s.
Some possible constructions "anna" + "elble", "anbna" + "elle", "anellena" + "b"

Example 2:

Input:

s = "leetcode", k = 3

Output:

false

Explanation:

It is impossible to construct 3 palindromes using all the characters of s.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "true", k = 4

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1402.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1402.html)

**Companies:** OT

## Description

A chef has collected data on the

satisfaction

level of
            his

n

dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

Like-time coefficient

of a dish is defined as the time taken to
                cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level  i.e.

time[i]

*

satisfaction[i]

Return the maximum sum of

## 1403-minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order.md

# 1403. Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1403.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1403.html)

**Companies:** mercari

## Description

Given the array

nums

, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of
            elements is

strictly greater

than the sum of the non included
            elements in such subsequence.

If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with

minimum
                size

and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence
                with the

maximum total sum

of all its elements. A subsequence of an
                array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be

unique

.
                Also return the answer sorted in

non-increasing

order.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [4,3,10,9,8]

Output:

[10,9]

Explanation:

The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included, however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [4,4,7,6,7]

Output:

[7,7,6]

Explanation:

The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing order.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [6]

Output:

[6]

1 <= nums.length <= 500

1 <= nums[i] <= 100

## 1406-stone-game-iii.md

# 1406. Stone Game III

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1406.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1406.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several
            stones

arranged in a row

, and each stone has an associated value
            which is an integer given in the array

stoneValue

.

Alice and Bob take turns, with

Alice

starting first. On each
                player's turn, that player can take

1, 2 or 3 stones

from the

first

remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each
                player is

0

initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the
                player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all
                the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob

play optimally

.

Return

"Alice"

if Alice will win,

"Bob"

if Bob will win or

"Tie"

if they end the game with the same score.

Example 1:

Input:

values = [1,2,3,7]

Output:

"Bob"

Explanation:

Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.

Example 2:

Input:

values = [1,2,3,-9]

Output:

"Alice"

Explanation:

Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

Example 3:

Input:

values = [1,2,3,6]

Output:

"Tie"

Explanation:

Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

Example 4:

Input:

values = [1,2,3,-1,-2,-3,7]

Output:

"Alice"

Example 5:

Input:

values = [-1,-2,-3]

Output:

"Tie"

## 1409-queries-on-a-permutation-with-key.md

# 1409. Queries on a Permutation With Key

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1409.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1409.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Given the array

queries

of positive integers between

1

and

m

, you have to process all

queries[i]

(from

i=0

to

i=queries.length-1

) according to the following rules:

In the beginning, you have the permutation

P=[1,2,3,...,m]

.

For the current

i

, find the position of

queries[i]

in
                    the permutation

P

(

indexing from 0

) and then move
                    this at the beginning of the permutation

P.

Notice that the
                    position of

queries[i]

in

P

is the result for

queries[i]

.

Return an array containing the result for the given

queries

.

Example 1:

Input:

queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5

Output:

[2,1,2,1]

Explanation:

The queries are processed as follow:
For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is

2

, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5].
For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is

1

, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5].
For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is

2

, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5].
For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is

1

, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5].
Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].

Example 2:

Input:

queries = [4,1,2,2], m = 4

Output:

[3,1,2,0]

Example 3:

Input:

queries = [7,5,5,8,3], m = 8

Output:

[6,5,0,7,5]

Constraints:

1 <= m <= 10^3

1 <= queries.length <= m

1 <= queries[i] <= m

**Companies:** Oracle

## Description

HTML entity parser

is the parser that takes HTML code as input and
            replace all the entities of the special characters by the characters itself.

The special characters and their entities for HTML are:

Quotation Mark:

the entity is

&quot;

and symbol
                    character is

"

.

Single Quote Mark:

the entity is

&apos;

and symbol character is

'

.

Ampersand:

the entity is

&amp;

and symbol
                    character is

&

.

Greater Than Sign:

the entity is

&gt;

and
                    symbol character is

>

.

Less Than Sign:

the entity is

&lt;

and
                    symbol character is

<

.

Slash:

the entity is

&frasl;

and symbol
                    character is

/

.

Given the input

text

string to the HTML parser, you have to implement
                the entity parser.

Return

the text

after replacing the entities by the special characters.

Example 1:

Input:

text = "&amp; is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not."

# 1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1415.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1415.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

A

happy string

is a string that:

consists only of letters of the set

['a', 'b', 'c']

.

s[i] != s[i + 1]

for all values of

i

from

1

to

s.length - 1

(string is 1-indexed).

For example, strings

"abc", "ac", "b"

and

"abcbabcbcb"

are all happy strings and strings

"aa",
                    "baa"

and

"ababbc"

are not happy strings.

Given two integers

n

and

k

, consider a list of all happy
                strings of length

n

sorted in lexicographical order.

Return

the kth string

of this list or return an

empty
                string

if there are less than

k

happy strings of length

n

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 1, k = 3

Output:

"c"

Explanation:

The list ["a", "b", "c"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is "c".

Example 2:

Input:

n = 1, k = 4

Output:

""

Explanation:

There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 3, k = 9

Output:

"cab"

Explanation:

There are 12 different happy string of length 3 ["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]. You will find the 9th string = "cab"

Example 4:

# 1416. Restore The Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1416.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1416.html)

**Companies:** Postman

## Description

A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print
            whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits and all we know is that all
            integers in the array were in the range

[1, k]

and there are no
            leading zeros in the array.

Given the string

s

and the integer

k

. There can be multiple
                ways to restore the array.

Return

the number of possible array

that can be printed as a string

s

using the mentioned program.

The number of ways could be very large so return it

modulo

10^9
                + 7

Example 1:

Input:

s = "1000", k = 10000

Output:

1

Explanation:

The only possible array is [1000]

Example 2:

Input:

s = "1000", k = 10

Output:

0

Explanation:

There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "1317", k = 2000

Output:

8

Explanation:

Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]

Example 4:

Input:

s = "2020", k = 30

Output:

1

Explanation:

The only possible array is [20,20]. [2020] is invalid because 2020 > 30. [2,020] is ivalid because 020 contains leading zeros.

Example 5:

Input:

s = "1234567890", k = 90

Output:

34

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5

.

s

# 1422. Maximum Score After Splitting a String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1422.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1422.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a string

s

of zeros and ones,

return the maximum
            score after splitting the string into two

non-empty

substrings

(i.e.

left

substring and

right

substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of

zeros

in the

left

substring plus the number of

ones

in the

right

substring.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "011101"

Output:

5

Explanation:

All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5
left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4
left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3
left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2
left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3

Example 2:

Input:

s = "00111"

Output:

5

Explanation:

When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5

Example 3:

Input:

s = "1111"

Output:

3

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 500

The string

s

consists of characters '0' and '1' only.

# 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1423.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1423.html)

**Companies:** Flipkart

## Description

There are several cards

arranged in a row

, and each card has
            an associated number of points The points are given in the integer
            array

cardPoints

.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You
                have to take exactly

k

cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array

cardPoints

and the integer

k

,
                return the

maximum score

you can obtain.

Example 1:

Input:

cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3

Output:

12

Explanation:

After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

Example 2:

Input:

cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2

Output:

4

Explanation:

Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

Example 3:

Input:

cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7

Output:

55

Explanation:

You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.

Example 4:

Input:

cardPoints = [1,1000,1], k = 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

You cannot take the card in the middle. Your best score is 1.

Example 5:

Input:

cardPoints = [1,79,80,1,1,1,200,1], k = 3

Output:

202

# 1430. Check If a String Is a Valid Sequence from Root to Leaves Path in a Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1430.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1430.html)

**Companies:** 23&me

## Description

Given a binary tree where each path going from the root to any leaf form a

valid
            sequence

, check if a given string is a

valid sequence

in
            such binary tree.

We get the given string from the concatenation of an array of integers

arr

and the concatenation of all values of the nodes along a path
                results in a

sequence

in the given binary tree.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,0,1]

Output:

true

Explanation:

The path 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 is a valid sequence (green color in the figure).
Other valid sequences are:
0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0
0 -> 0 -> 0

Example 2:

Input:

root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,0,1]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The path 0 -> 0 -> 1 does not exist, therefore it is not even a sequence.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,1]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The path 0 -> 1 -> 1 is a sequence, but it is not a valid sequence.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 5000

0 <= arr[i] <= 9

Each node's value is between [0 - 9].

## 1431-kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies.md

# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1431.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1431.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given the array

candies

and the integer

extraCandies

,
            where

candies[i]

represents the number of candies that the

ith

kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute

extraCandies

among
                the kids such that he or she can have the

greatest

number of
                candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the

greatest

number of candies.

Example 1:

Input:

candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3

Output:

[true,true,true,false,true]

Explanation:

Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids.
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids.
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies.
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.

Example 2:

Input:

candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1

Output:

[true,false,false,false,false]

Explanation:

There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.

Example 3:

Input:

candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10

Output:

[true,false,true]

Constraints:

**Companies:** mercari

## Description

You are given an integer

num

. You will apply the following steps
            exactly

two

times:

Pick a digit

x (0 <= x <= 9)

.

Pick another digit

y (0 <= y <= 9)

. The digit

y

can be equal to

x

.

Replace all the occurrences of

x

in the decimal representation of

num

by

y

.

The new integer

cannot

have any leading zeros, also the new
                    integer

cannot

be 0.

Let

a

b

be the results of applying the
                operations to

num

the first and second times, respectively.

Return

the max difference

between

a

and

b

.

Example 1:

Input:

num = 555

Output:

888

Explanation:

The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888

Example 2:

## 1438-longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit.md

# 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1438.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1438.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array of integers

nums

and an integer

limit

, return the size of the longest continuous subarray such that the
            absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal
            to

limit

.

In case there is no subarray satisfying the given condition return 0.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4

Output:

2

Explanation:

All subarrays are:
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4.
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5

Output:

4

Explanation:

The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0

Output:

## Description

You are given an

m * n

matrix,

mat

,
            and an integer

k

, which has its rows sorted in non-decreasing order.

You are allowed to choose exactly 1 element from each row to form an array. Return
                the Kth

smallest

array sum among all possible arrays.

Example 1:

Input:

mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 5

Output:

7

Explanation:

Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are:
[1,2], [1,4], [3,2], [3,4], [1,6]. Where the 5th sum is 7.

Example 2:

Input:

mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 9

Output:

17

Example 3:

Input:

mat = [[1,10,10],[1,4,5],[2,3,6]], k = 7

Output:

9

Explanation:

Choosing one element from each row, the first k smallest sum are:
[1,1,2], [1,1,3], [1,4,2], [1,4,3], [1,1,6], [1,5,2], [1,5,3]. Where the 7th sum is 9.

Example 4:

Input:

mat = [[1,1,10],[2,2,9]], k = 7

Output:

12

Constraints:

m == mat.length

n == mat.length[i]

1 <= m, n <= 40

1 <= k <= min(200, n ^ m)

# 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1441.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1441.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array

target

and an integer

n

. In each
            iteration, you will read a number from

list = {1,2,3..., n}

.

Build the

target

array using the following operations:

Push

: Read a new element from the
                    beginning

list

, and push it in the array.

Pop

: delete the last element of the array.

If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.

You are guaranteed that the target array is strictly increasing, only containing numbers
                between 1 to

n

inclusive.

Return the operations to build the target array.

You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input:

target = [1,3], n = 3

Output:

["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]

Explanation:

Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]
Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]
Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]

Example 2:

Input:

target = [1,2,3], n = 3

Output:

["Push","Push","Push"]

Example 3:

Input:

target = [1,2], n = 4

Explanation:

You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.

Example 4:

Input:

target = [2,3,4], n = 4

Output:

["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]

Constraints:

1 <= target.length <= 100

# 1449. Form Largest Integer With Digits That Add up to Target

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1449.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1449.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array of integers

cost

and an integer

target

.
            Return the

maximum

integer you can paint under the following
            rules:

The cost of painting a digit (i+1) is given by

cost[i]

(0
                    indexed).

The total cost used must be equal to

target

.

Integer does not have digits 0.

Since the answer may be too large, return it as string.

If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return "0".

Example 1:

Input:

cost = [4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5], target = 9

Output:

"7772"

Explanation:

The cost to paint the digit '7' is 2, and the digit '2' is 3. Then cost("7772") = 2*3+ 3*1 = 9. You could also paint "997", but "7772" is the largest number.

Digit    cost

1  ->   4
  2  ->   3
  3  ->   2
  4  ->   5
  5  ->   6
  6  ->   7
  7  ->   2
  8  ->   5
  9  ->   5

Example 2:

Input:

cost = [7,6,5,5,5,6,8,7,8], target = 12

Output:

"85"

Explanation:

The cost to paint the digit '8' is 7, and the digit '5' is 5. Then cost("85") = 7 + 5 = 12.

Example 3:

Input:

cost = [2,4,6,2,4,6,4,4,4], target = 5

Output:

"0"

Explanation:

It's not possible to paint any integer with total cost equal to target.

Example 4:

Input:

cost = [6,10,15,40,40,40,40,40,40], target = 47

Output:

"32211"

Constraints:

cost.length == 9

is the list of favorites companies for the

ith

person (

indexed from 0

).

Return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a

subset

of any other list of favorites companies

. You must return the indices in
                increasing order.

Example 1:

Input:

favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["google","microsoft"],["google","facebook"],["google"],["amazon"]]

Output:

[0,1,4]

Explanation:

Person with index=2 has favoriteCompanies[2]=["google","facebook"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"] corresponding to the person with index 0.
Person with index=3 has favoriteCompanies[3]=["google"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"] and favoriteCompanies[1]=["google","microsoft"].
Other lists of favorite companies are not a subset of another list, therefore, the answer is [0,1,4].

Example 2:

Input:

favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["leetcode","amazon"],["facebook","google"]]

Output:

[0,1]

Explanation:

In this case favoriteCompanies[2]=["facebook","google"] is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"], therefore, the answer is [0,1].

## Description

SQL Schema

Table

Accounts

:

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
the id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.

Table

Logins

:

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.

Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for 5 or more consecutive
                days.

Return the result table

ordered

by the id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |

| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+

Result table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.

Follow up question:

Can you write a general solution if the active users
                are those who logged in to their accounts for

n

or more consecutive
                days?

## Description

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary
            tree is said to be

pseudo-palindromic

if at least one permutation of
            the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of

pseudo-palindromic

paths going from the
                root node to leaf nodes.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]

Output:

## Description

Given two arrays

nums1

and

nums2

.

Return the maximum dot product between

non-empty

subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by
                deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative
                positions of the remaining characters. (ie,

[2,3,5]

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

Given two integer arrays of equal length

target

and

arr

.

In one step, you can select any

non-empty sub-array

of

arr

and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return

True

if you can make

arr

equal to

target

,
                or

False

otherwise.

Example 1:

Input:

target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]

Output:

true

Explanation:

You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.

Example 2:

Input:

target = [7], arr = [7]

Output:

true

Explanation:

arr is equal to target without any reverses.

Example 3:

Input:

target = [1,12], arr = [12,1]

Output:

true

Example 4:

Input:

target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]

Output:

false

Explanation:

arr doesn't have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.

Example 5:

Input:

target = [1,1,1,1,1], arr = [1,1,1,1,1]

Output:

true

Constraints:

target.length == arr.length

## Description

Given a

rows x cols

matrix

grid

representing a field of
            cherries. Each cell in

grid

represents the number of
            cherries that you can collect.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you, Robot #1 is located at
                the top-left corner (0,0) , and Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0,
                cols-1) of the grid.

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots  by following
                the rules below:

From a cell (i,j), robots can move to cell (i+1, j-1) , (i+1, j) or (i+1,
                    j+1).

When any robot is passing through a cell, It picks it up all cherries, and the
                    cell becomes an empty cell (0).

When both robots stay on the same cell, only one of them takes the cherries.

Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.

Both robots should reach the bottom row in the

grid

.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]

# 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1466.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1466.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

There are

n

cities numbered from

0

to

n-1

and

n-1

roads such that there is only one way to travel between
            two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry
            of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too
            narrow.

Roads are represented by

connections

where

connections[i]
                = [a, b]

represents a road from city

a

to

b

.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to
                travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the
                city 0. Return the

minimum

number of edges changed.

It's

guaranteed

that each city can reach the city 0 after reorder.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]

Output:

## 1467-probability-of-a-two-boxes-having-the-same-number-of-distinct-balls.md

# 1467. Probability of a Two Boxes Having The Same Number of Distinct Balls

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1467.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1467.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given

2n

balls of

k

distinct colors. You will be given an
            integer array

balls

of size

k

where

balls[i]

is
            the number of balls of color

i

.

All the balls will be

shuffled uniformly at random

, then we
                will distribute the first

n

balls to the first box and the remaining

n

balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second
                example carefully).

Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two
                balls of colors

a

and

b

, and two boxes

[]

and

()

, then the distribution

[a] (b)

is considered different
                than the distribution

[b] (a)

(Please read the explanation of the
                first example carefully).

We want to

calculate the probability

that the two boxes have the same number
                of distinct balls.

Example 1:

Input:

balls = [1,1]

Output:

1.00000

Explanation:

Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1

Example 2:

Input:

balls = [2,1,1]

Output:

0.66667

Explanation:

We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equale probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

Example 3:

Input:

balls = [1,2,1,2]

Output:

0.60000

Explanation:

The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.
Probability = 108 / 180 = 0.6

Example 4:

Input:

balls = [3,2,1]

Output:

0.30000

Explanation:

The set of balls is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]. It is hard to display all the 60 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 18 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.
Probability = 18 / 60 = 0.3

Example 5:

Input:

balls = [6,6,6,6,6,6]

Output:

0.90327

Constraints:

1 <= balls.length <= 8

1 <= balls[i] <= 6

sum(balls)

is even.

Answers within

10^-5

of the actual value will be accepted as
                    correct.

# 1471. The k Strongest Values in an Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1471.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1471.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array of integers

arr

and an integer

k

.

A value

arr[i]

is said to be stronger than a value

arr[j]

if

|arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m|

where

m

is the

median

of the array.

If

|arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|

, then

arr[i]

is said to be
                stronger than

arr[j]

if

arr[i] > arr[j]

.

Return

a list of the strongest

k

values in the array. return
                the answer

in any arbitrary order

.

Median

is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More
                formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position

((n - 1) / 2)

in the sorted list

(0-indexed)

.

For

arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11]

,

n = 5

and the
                    median is obtained by sorting the array

arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7,
                        11]

and the median is

arr[m]

where

m = ((5 - 1) /
                        2) = 2

. The median is

6

.

For

arr = [-7, 22, 17,â3]

,

n = 4

and the
                    median is obtained by sorting the array

arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22]

and the median is

arr[m]

where

m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1

.
                    The median is

3

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

Output:

[5,1]

Explanation:

Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also

accepted

answer.
Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2

Output:

[5,5]

Explanation:

Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [6,7,11,7,6,8], k = 5

Output:

[11,8,6,6,7]

Explanation:

Median is 7, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [11,8,6,6,7,7].
Any permutation of [11,8,6,6,7] is

accepted

.

Example 4:

Input:

arr = [6,-3,7,2,11], k = 3

Output:

[-3,11,2]

Example 5:

Input:

arr = [-7,22,17,3], k = 2

Output:

[22,17]

prices

where

prices[i]

is the price of the

ith

item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if
            you buy the

ith

item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to

prices[j]

where

j

is the

minimum

index such that

# 1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1477.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1477.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array of integers

arr

and an integer

target

.

You have to find

two non-overlapping sub-arrays

of

arr

each with sum equal

target

. There can be multiple answers so you have
                to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is

minimum

.

Return

the minimum sum of the lengths

of the two required sub-arrays, or
                return

-1

if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3

Output:

2

Explanation:

Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7

Output:

2

Explanation:

Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6

Output:

-1

Explanation:

We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.

Example 4:

Input:

arr = [5,5,4,4,5], target = 3

Output:

-1

Explanation:

We cannot find a sub-array of sum = 3.

Example 5:

Input:

arr = [3,1,1,1,5,1,2,1], target = 3

Output:

3

Explanation:

Note that sub-arrays [1,2] and [2,1] cannot be an answer because they overlap.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

1 <= target <= 10^8

## 1482-minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets.md

# 1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1482.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1482.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an integer array

bloomDay

, an integer

m

and an
            integer

k

.

We need to make

m

bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use

k

adjacent flowers

from the garden.

The garden consists of

n

flowers, the

ith

flower will bloom
                in the

bloomDay[i]

and then can be used in

exactly
                    one

bouquet.

Return

the minimum number of days

you need to wait to be able to make

m

bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make

m

bouquets return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1

Output:

3

Explanation:

Let's see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower didn't bloom in the garden.
We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2

Output:

-1

Explanation:

We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.

Example 3:

Input:

bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3

Output:

12

Explanation:

We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here's the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.

Example 4:

Input:

bloomDay = [1000000000,1000000000], m = 1, k = 1

Output:

1000000000

Explanation:

You need to wait 1000000000 days to have a flower ready for a bouquet.

Example 5:

Input:

bloomDay = [1,10,2,9,3,8,4,7,5,6], m = 4, k = 2

Output:

9

Constraints:

bloomDay.length == n

1 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9

1 <= m <= 10^6

1 <= k <= n

n

nodes numbered
            from

0

to

n-1

in the form of a parent
            array where

parent[i]

is the parent of node

i

. The root
            of the tree is node

0

.

Implement the function

getKthAncestor

(int node, int k)

to
                return the

k

-th ancestor of the given

node

. If there
                is no such ancestor, return

# 1485. Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1485.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1485.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer
            which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a

deep copy

of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where
                each node is represented as a pair of

[val, random_index]

where:

val

: an integer representing

Node.val

random_index

: the index of the node (in the input) where the random
                    pointer points to, or

null

if it does not point to any
                    node.

You will be given the tree in class

Node

and you should return the
                cloned tree in class

NodeCopy

.

NodeCopy

class is just a
                clone of

Node

class with the same attributes and constructors.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]

Output:

[[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]

Explanation:

The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].
The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].
The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] where 3 is the index of node 7 in the array representing the tree.
The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]

Output:

[[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]

Explanation:

The random pointer of a node can be the node itself.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

Output:

[[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

Example 4:

Input:

root = []

Output:

[]

Example 5:

Input:

root = [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]

Output:

[[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the

tree

is in the
                    range

[0, 1000].

Each node's value is between

[1, 10^6]

## 1487-making-file-names-unique.md

# 1487. Making File Names Unique

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1487.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1487.html)

**Companies:** Oasis Labs

## Description

Given an array of strings

names

of size

n

. You will create

n

folders in your file system

such that

, at the

ith

minute, you will create a folder with the name

names[i]

.

Since two files

cannot

have the same name, if you enter a folder
                name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition
                to its name in the form of

(k)

, where,

k

is the

smallest positive integer

such that the obtained name remains
                unique.

Return

an array of strings of length

n

where

ans[i]

is the actual name the system will assign to the

ith

folder when you create it.

Example 1:

Input:

names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]

Output:

["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]

Explanation:

Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
"fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"

Example 2:

Input:

names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]

Output:

["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]

Explanation:

Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
"gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
"avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"

Example 3:

Input:

names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]

Output:

["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]

Explanation:

When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes "onepiece(4)".

Example 4:

Input:

names = ["wano","wano","wano","wano"]

Output:

["wano","wano(1)","wano(2)","wano(3)"]

Explanation:

Just increase the value of k each time you create folder "wano".

Example 5:

Input:

names = ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido","kaido(1)"]

Output:

["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido(2)","kaido(1)(1)"]

Explanation:

Please note that system adds the suffix (k) to current name even it contained the same suffix before.

Constraints:

1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10^4

1 <= names[i].length <= 20

names[i]

consists of lower case English letters, digits and/or
                    round brackets.

# 1488. Avoid Flood in The City

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1488.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1488.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty,
            but when it rains over the

nth

lake, the

nth

lake becomes full
            of water. If it rains over a lake which is

full of water

, there will be
            a

flood

. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array

rains

where:

rains[i] > 0

means there will be rains over the

rains[i]

lake.

rains[i] == 0

means there are no rains this day and you can choose

one lake

this day and

dry it

.

Return

an array

ans

where:

ans.length == rains.length

ans[i] == -1

if

rains[i] > 0

.

ans[i]

is the lake you choose to dry in the

ith

day if

rains[i] == 0

.

If there are multiple valid answers return

any

of them. If it is
                impossible to avoid flood return

an empty array

.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to
                dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)

Example 1:

Input:

rains = [1,2,3,4]

Output:

[-1,-1,-1,-1]

Explanation:

After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.

Example 2:

Input:

rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]

Output:

[-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]

Explanation:

After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.

Example 3:

Input:

rains = [1,2,0,1,2]

Output:

[]

Explanation:

After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.
After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.

Example 4:

Input:

rains = [69,0,0,0,69]

Output:

[-1,69,1,1,-1]

Explanation:

Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9

Example 5:

Input:

rains = [10,20,20]

Output:

[]

Explanation:

It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.

Constraints:

1 <= rains.length <= 10^5

0 <= rains[i] <= 10^9

## 1489-find-critical-and-pseudo-critical-edges-in-minimum-spanning-tree.md

# 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1489.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1489.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Given a weighted undirected connected graph with

n

vertices
            numbered from

0

to

n-1

, and an array

edges

where

edges[i] = [from

i

, to

i

, weight

i

]

represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between
            nodes

from

i

and

to

i

. A minimum
            spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all vertices
            without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find

all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree
                (MST) of the given graph

. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause
                the MST weight to increase is called a

critical edge

. A

pseudo-critical
                    edge

, on the other hand, is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]

Output:

[[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]

Explanation:

The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]

Output:

[[],[0,1,2,3]]

Explanation:

We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100

1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)

edges[i].length == 3

0 <= from

i

< to

i

< n

1 <= weight

i

<= 1000

All pairs

(from

i

, to

i

)

are distinct.

## Description

Given an array of integers

nums

and an integer

target

.

Return the number of

non-empty

subsequences of

nums

such
            that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal than

target

.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9

Output:

4

Explanation:

There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)

Example 2:

# 1499. Max Value of Equation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1499.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1499.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array

points

containing the coordinates of points on a 2D
            plane, sorted by the x-values, where

points[i] = [x

i

,
                y

i

]

such that

x

i

<
                x

j

for all

1 <= i < j <= points.length

. You
            are also given an integer

k

.

Find the

maximum value of the equation

y

i

+ y

j

+
            |x

i

- x

j

|

where

|x

i

-
            x

j

| <= k

and

1 <= i < j <=
            points.length

. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points
            that satisfy the constraint

|x

i

- x

j

| <=
                k

.

Example 1:

Input:

points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1

Output:

4

Explanation:

The first two points satisfy the condition |x

i

- x

j

| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.

Example 2:

Input:

points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3

Output:

3

Explanation:

Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.

Constraints:

2 <= points.length <= 10^5

points[i].length == 2

-10^8 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8

0 <= k <= 2 * 10^8

points[i][0] < points[j][0]

## 1500-design-a-file-sharing-system.md

# 1500. Design a File Sharing System

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1500.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1500.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

We will use a file-sharing system to share a very large file which consists of

m

small

chunks

with IDs from

1

to

m

.

When users join the system, the system should assign

a unique

ID to them.
                The unique ID should be used

once

for each user, but when a user leaves the
                system, the ID can be

reused

again.

Users can request a certain chunk of the file, the system should return a list of IDs
                of all the users who have this chunk. After that, if at least one other has this
                chunk, the user who requested the chunk

will get it

.

Implement the

FileSharing

class:

FileSharing(int m)

Initializes the object with the number of the
                    chunks of the file

m

.

int join(int[] ownedChunks)

: A new user joined the system owning
                    some chunks of the file, the system should assign an id to the user which is the

smallest positive integer

not taken by any other user. Return the
                    assigned id.

void leave(int userID)

: The user with

userID

will
                    leave the system, you cannot take file chunks from them anymore.

int[] request(int userID, int chunkID)

: The user with

userID

requested the file chunk with

chunkID

. Return a list of the IDs of
                    all users that own this chunk sorted in ascending order.

Follow-ups:

What happens if the system identifies the user by their IP address instead
                    of their unique ID and users disconnect and connect from the system with the
                    same IP?

If the users in the system join and leave the system frequently without
                    requesting any chunks, will your solution still be efficient?

If all each user join the system one time, request all files and then leave,
                    will your solution still be efficient?

If the system will be used to share

n

files where the

ith

file consists of

m[i]

, what are the changes you
                    have to do?

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
["FileSharing","join","join","join","request","request","leave","request","leave","join"]
[[4],[[1,2]],[[2,3]],[[4]],[1,3],[2,2],[1],[2,1],[2],[[]]]
Output:
[null,1,2,3,[2],[1,2],null,[],null,1]
Explanation:
FileSharing fileSharing = new FileSharing(4); // We use the system to share a file of 4 chunks.
fileSharing.join([1, 2]);    // A user who has chunks [1,2] joined the system, assign id = 1 to them and return 1.
fileSharing.join([2, 3]);    // A user who has chunks [2,3] joined the system, assign id = 2 to them and return 2.
fileSharing.join([4]);       // A user who has chunk [4] joined the system, assign id = 3 to them and return 3.
fileSharing.request(1, 3);   // The user with id = 1 requested the third file chunk, as only the user with id = 2 has the file, return [2] . Notice that user 1 now has chunks [1,2,3].
fileSharing.request(2, 2);   // The user with id = 2 requested the second file chunk, users with ids [1,2] have this chunk, thus we return [1,2]. We don't care if the user has the file and request it, we just return all the users that can give them the file.
fileSharing.leave(1);        // The user with id = 1 left the system, all the file chunks with them are no longer available for other users.
fileSharing.request(2, 1);   // The user with id = 2 requested the first file chunk, no one in the system has this chunk, we return empty list [].
fileSharing.leave(2);        // The user with id = 2 left the system, all the file chunks with them are no longer available for other users.
fileSharing.join([]);        // A user who doesn't have any chunks joined the system, assign id = 1 to them and return 1. Notice that ids 1 and 2 are free and we can reuse them.
Constraints:
1 <= m <= 10^5
0 <= ownedChunks.length <= min(100, m)
1 <= ownedChunks[i] <= m
Values of
ownedChunks
are unique.
1 <= chunkID <= m
userID
is guaranteed to be a user in the system if you
assign
the IDs
correctly
.
At most
10^4
calls will be made to
join
,
leave
and
request
.
Each call to
leave
will have a matching call for
join
.

The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 102 + 330 + 330 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 8 = 9.37500
The average call duration for Morocco is (33 + 4 + 59 + 59 + 3 + 7) / 6 = 27.5000
Global call duration average = (2 * (33 + 3 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7)) / 20 = 55.70000
Since Peru is the only country where average call duration is greater than the global average, it's the only recommended country.

# 1503. Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1503.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1503.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

We have a wooden plank of the length

n

units

.
            Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with speed

1 unit per
                second

. Some of the ants move to the

left

, the other move
            to the

right

.

When two ants moving in two

different

directions meet at some point,
                they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions
                doesn't take any additional time.

When an ant reaches

one end

of the plank at a time

t

,
                it falls out of the plank imediately.

Given an integer

n

and two integer arrays

left

and

right

,
                the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right. Return

the moment

when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, left = [4,3], right = [0,1]

Output:

4

Explanation:

In the image above:
-The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right.
-The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.
-The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.
-The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.
Note that the last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 second, after that it falls imediately out of the plank. (i.e. We can say that at t = 4.0000000001, there is no ants on the plank).

Example 2:

Input:

n = 7, left = [], right = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output:

7

Explanation:

All ants are going to the right, the ant at index 0 needs 7 seconds to fall.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 7, left = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], right = []

Output:

7

Explanation:

All ants are going to the left, the ant at index 7 needs 7 seconds to fall.

Example 4:

Input:

n = 9, left = [5], right = [4]

Output:

5

Explanation:

At t = 1 second, both ants will be at the same intial position but with different direction.

Example 5:

Input:

n = 6, left = [6], right = [0]

Output:

6

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4

0 <= left.length <= n + 1

0 <= left[i] <= n

0 <= right.length <= n + 1

0 <= right[i] <= n

1 <= left.length + right.length <= n + 1

All values of

left

and

right

are unique, and each
                    value can appear

only in one

of the two arrays.

# 1508. Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1508.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1508.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given the array

nums

consisting of

n

positive integers.
            You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays from the array and then
            sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of

n * (n + 1) / 2

numbers.

Return the sum of the numbers from index

left

to
                index

right

(

indexed from 1

)

, inclusive, in
                the new array.

Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo
                10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5

Output:

13

Explanation:

All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4

Output:

6

Explanation:

The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10

Output:

50

Constraints:

# 1510. Stone Game IV

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1510.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1510.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are

n

stones in a pile.  On each player's turn,
                that player makes a

move

consisting of removing

any

non-zero

square number

of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer

n

. Return

True

if
                and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return

False

, assuming both
                players play optimally.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 1

Output:

true

Explanation:

Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 2

Output:

false

Explanation:

Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).

Example 3:

Input:

n = 4

Output:

true

Explanation:

n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).

Example 4:

Input:

n = 7

Output:

false

Explanation:

Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).

Example 5:

Input:

n = 17

Output:

false

Explanation:

Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.

# 1515. Best Position for a Service Centre

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1515.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1515.html)

**Companies:** Citadel

## Description

A delivery company wants to build a new service centre in a new city. The company knows
            the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new
            centre in a position such that

the sum of the euclidean distances to all
                customers is minimum

.

Given an array

positions

where

positions[i] = [x

i

,
            y

i

]

is the position of the

ith

customer on the map,
            return

the minimum sum of the euclidean distances

to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service centre

[x

centre

, y

centre

]

such that the following formula is
            minimized:

Answers within

10^-5

of the actual value will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input:

positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]

Output:

4.00000

Explanation:

As shown, you can see that choosing [x

centre

, y

centre

] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.

Example 2:

Input:

positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]

Output:

2.82843

Explanation:

The minimum possible sum of distances = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.82843

Example 3:

Input:

positions = [[1,1]]

Output:

0.00000

Example 4:

Input:

positions = [[1,1],[0,0],[2,0]]

Output:

2.73205

Explanation:

At the first glance, you may think that locating the centre at [1, 0] will achieve the minimum sum, but locating it at [1, 0] will make the sum of distances = 3.
Try to locate the centre at [1.0, 0.5773502711] you will see that the sum of distances is 2.73205.
Be careful with the precision!

Example 5:

Input:

positions = [[0,1],[3,2],[4,5],[7,6],[8,9],[11,1],[2,12]]

Output:

32.94036

Explanation:

You can use [4.3460852395, 4.9813795505] as the position of the centre.

Constraints:

1 <= positions.length <= 50

after adjusting it.

There are 3 cases for nodes

p

and

q

:

Node

q

is in the sub-tree of node

p

.

Node

p

is in the sub-tree of node

q

.

Neither node

p

is in the sub-tree of node

q

nor
                    node

q

is in the sub-tree of node

p

.

In cases 2 and 3, you just need to move

p

(with its
                sub-tree) to be a child of

q

, but in case 1 the tree may be
                disconnected, thus you need to reconnect the tree again.

Please read the
                    examples carefully before solving this problem.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal,
                each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

For example, the above tree is serialized as
                [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].

Example 1:

Input:

root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 4, q = 1

Output:

[1,null,2,3,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,8]

Explanation:

This example follows the second case as node p is in the sub-tree of node q. We move node p with its sub-tree to be a direct child of node q.
Notice that node 4 is the last child of node 1.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 7, q = 4

Output:

[1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8]

Explanation:

Node 7 is already a direct child of node 4. We don't change anything.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 3, q = 8

Output:

[1,null,2,null,4,5,null,7,8,null,null,null,3,null,6]

Explanation:

This example follows case 3 because node p is not in the sub-tree of node q and vice-versa. We can move node 3 with its sub-tree and make it as node 8's child.

Example 4:

Input:

root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 2, q = 7

Output:

[1,null,7,3,null,2,null,6,null,4,5,null,null,8]

Explanation:

Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.
The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.
Then we will see that the tree is disconnected, you need to reconnect node q to replace node p as shown.

Example 5:

Input:

root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 1, q = 2

Output:

[2,null,4,5,1,null,7,8,null,null,3,null,null,null,6]

Explanation:

Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.
The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.
As node p was the root of the tree, node q replaces it and becomes the root of the tree.

Constraints:

The total number of nodes is between

[2, 1000]

.

Each node has a

unique

value.

p != null

q != null

p

and

q

are two different nodes (i.e.

p !=
                    q

).

# 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1519.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1519.html)

**Companies:** Samsung

## Description

Given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of

n

nodes numbered from

0

to

n - 1

and exactly

n - 1

edges

. The

root

of the tree is the node

0

, and each node of the tree has

a label

which is a
            lower-case character given in the string

labels

(i.e. The node with the
            number

i

has the label

labels[i]

).

The

edges

array is given on the form

edges[i] = [a

i

,
                b

i

]

, which means there is an edge between nodes

a

i

and

b

i

in the tree.

Return

an array of size

n

where

ans[i]

is the
                number of nodes in the subtree of the

i

th

node
                which have the same label as node

i

.

A subtree of a tree

T

is the tree consisting of a node in

T

and all of its descendant nodes.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"

Output:

[2,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Explanation:

Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.
Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).

Example 2:

Input:

n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = "bbbb"

Output:

[4,2,1,1]

Explanation:

The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.
The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.
The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[0,4]], labels = "aabab"

Output:

[3,2,1,1,1]

Example 4:

Input:

n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[3,4],[4,5]], labels = "cbabaa"

Output:

[1,2,1,1,2,1]

Example 5:

Input:

n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6]], labels = "aaabaaa"

Output:

[6,5,4,1,3,2,1]

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

edges.length == n - 1

edges[i].length == 2

0 <= a

i

## 1520-maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-substrings.md

# 1520. Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1520.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1520.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Given a string

s

of lowercase letters, you need to find the
            maximum number of

non-empty

substrings of

s

that
            meet the following conditions:

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings

s[i..j]

and

s[k..l]

, either

j < k

or

i > l

is true.

A substring that contains a certain character

c

must also
                    contain all occurrences of

c

.

Find

the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions

. If
                there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings,

return the one
                    with minimum total length.

It can be shown that there exists a unique
                solution of minimum total length.

Notice that you can return the substrings in

any

order.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "adefaddaccc"

Output:

["e","f","ccc"]

Explanation:

The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  "adefaddaccc"
  "adefadda",
  "ef",
  "e",
  "f",
  "ccc",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose "adefadda", we are left with "ccc" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose "ef" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose ["e","f","ccc"] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "abbaccd"

Output:

["d","bb","cc"]

Explanation:

Notice that while the set of substrings ["d","abba","cc"] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5

s

contains only lowercase English letters.

# 1521. Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1521.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1521.html)

**Companies:** American Express

## Description

Winston was given the above mysterious function

func

. He has an integer
                array

arr

and an integer

target

and he wants to find the
                values

l

and

r

that make the value

|func(arr,
                    l, r) - target|

minimum possible.

Return

the minimum possible value

of

|func(arr, l, r) - target|

.

Notice that

func

should be called with the values

l

and

r

where

0 <= l, r < arr.length

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [9,12,3,7,15], target = 5

Output:

2

Explanation:

Calling func with all the pairs of [l,r] = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4],[0,3],[1,4],[0,4]], Winston got the following results [9,12,3,7,15,8,0,3,7,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The value closest to 5 is 7 and 3, thus the minimum difference is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1000000,1000000,1000000], target = 1

Output:

999999

Explanation:

Winston called the func with all possible values of [l,r] and he always got 1000000, thus the min difference is 999999.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [1,2,4,8,16], target = 0

# 1529. Bulb Switcher IV

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1529.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1529.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

There is a room with

n

bulbs, numbered from

0

to

n-1

, arranged
            in a row from left to right. Initially all the bulbs are

turned off

.

Your task is to obtain the configuration represented by

target

where

target[i]

is '1' if the i-th bulb is turned on and is '0' if it is turned off.

You have a switch to flip the state of the bulb, a flip operation is
                defined as follows:

Choose

any

bulb (index

i

) of your
                    current configuration.

Flip each bulb from index

i

to

n-1

.

When any bulb is flipped it means that if it is 0 it changes to 1 and if it is 1 it
                changes to 0.

Return the

minimum

number of flips required to form

target

.

Example 1:

Input:

target = "10111"

Output:

3

Explanation:

Initial configuration "00000".
flip from the third bulb:  "00000" -> "00111"
flip from the first bulb:  "00111" -> "11000"
flip from the second bulb:  "11000" -> "10111"
We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.

Example 2:

Input:

target = "101"

Output:

Explanation:

"000" -> "111" -> "100" -> "101".

Example 3:

Input:

target = "00000"

Output:

0

Example 4:

Input:

target = "001011101"

## 1531-string-compression-ii.md

# 1531. String Compression II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1531.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1531.html)

**Companies:** Toptal

## Description

Run-length encoding

is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical
            characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the
            number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress
            the string

"aabccc"

we replace

"aa"

by

"a2"

and replace

"ccc"

by

"c3"

. Thus the compressed string becomes

"a2bc3"

.

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding

'1'

after
                single characters.

Given a string

s

and an integer

k

. You need to
                delete

at most

k

characters
                from

s

such that the run-length encoded version of

s

has minimum length.

Find the

minimum length of the run-length encoded version
                of

s

after deleting at most

k

characters

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aaabcccd", k = 2

Output:

4

Explanation:

Compressing s without deleting anything will give us "a3bc3d" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = "abcccd" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be "a3c3" of length 4.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aabbaa", k = 2

Output:

2

Explanation:

If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be "a4" of length 2.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "aaaaaaaaaaa", k = 0

Output:

3

Explanation:

Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is "a11" of length 3.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100

0 <= k <= s.length

s

contains only lowercase English letters.

# 1533. Find the Index of the Large Integer

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1533.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1533.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

We have an integer array

arr

, where all the integers in

arr

are equal except for one integer which is

larger

than
            the rest of the integers. You will not be given direct access to the array, instead, you
            will have an

API

ArrayReader

which have the following
            functions:

int compareSub(int l, int r, int x, int y)

: where

0 <= l,
                    r, x, y < ArrayReader.length()

,

l <= r
                    and

x <= y

. The function compares the sum of
                    sub-array

arr[l..r]

with the sum of the sub-array

arr[x..y]

and returns:

1

if

arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] >
                            arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]

.

0

if

arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] ==
                            arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]

.

-1

if

arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] <
                            arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]

.

int length()

: Returns the size of the array.

You are allowed to call

compareSub()

20 times

at most.
                You can assume both functions work in

O(1)

time.

Return

the index of the array

arr

which has the largest integer

.

Follow-up:

What if there are two numbers in

arr

that are bigger than all other
                    numbers?

What if there is one number that is bigger than other numbers and one number
                    that is smaller than other numbers?

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [7,7,7,7,10,7,7,7]

Output:

4

Explanation:

The following calls to the API
reader.compareSub(0, 0, 1, 1) // returns 0 this is a query comparing the sub-array (0, 0) with the sub array (1, 1), (i.e. compares arr[0] with arr[1]).
Thus we know that arr[0] and arr[1] doesn't contain the largest element.
reader.compareSub(2, 2, 3, 3) // returns 0, we can exclude arr[2] and arr[3].
reader.compareSub(4, 4, 5, 5) // returns 1, thus for sure arr[4] is the largest element in the array.
Notice that we made only 3 calls, so the answer is valid.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [6,6,12]

Output:

2

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^5

1 <= arr[i] <= 100

All elements of

arr

are equal except for one element which is
                    larger than all other elements.

# 1537. Get the Maximum Score

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1537.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1537.html)

**Companies:** MindTickle

## Description

You are given two

sorted

arrays of distinct integers

nums1

and

nums2.

A

valid

path

is defined as follows:

Choose array nums1 or nums2 to traverse (from index-0).

Traverse the current array from left to right.

If you are reading any value that is present in

nums1

and

nums2

you
                    are allowed to change your path to the other array. (Only one repeated value is
                    considered in the valid path).

Score

is defined as the sum of uniques values in a valid path.

Return the maximum

score

you can obtain of all possible

valid paths

.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:

nums1 = [2,4,5,8,10], nums2 = [4,6,8,9]

Output:

30

Explanation:

Valid paths:
[2,4,5,8,10], [2,4,5,8,9], [2,4,6,8,9], [2,4,6,8,10],  (starting from nums1)
[4,6,8,9], [4,5,8,10], [4,5,8,9], [4,6,8,10]    (starting from nums2)
The maximum is obtained with the path in green

[2,4,6,8,10]

.

Example 2:

Input:

nums1 = [1,3,5,7,9], nums2 = [3,5,100]

Output:

109

Explanation:

Maximum sum is obtained with the path

[1,3,5,100]

.

Example 3:

Input:

nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [6,7,8,9,10]

Output:

40

Explanation:

There are no common elements between nums1 and nums2.
Maximum sum is obtained with the path [6,7,8,9,10].

Example 4:

Input:

nums1 = [1,4,5,8,9,11,19], nums2 = [2,3,4,11,12]

Output:

61

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= 10^5

1 <= nums2.length <= 10^5

1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^7

# 1538. Guess the Majority in a Hidden Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1538.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1538.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

We have an integer array

nums

, where all the integers
            in

nums

are

0

or

1

. You will
            not be given direct access to the array, instead, you will have
            an

API

ArrayReader

which have the following
            functions:

int query(int a, int b, int c, int d)

: where

0 <= a < b
                    < c < d < ArrayReader.length()

. The function
                    returns the distribution of the value of the 4 elements and returns:

4

: if the values of the 4 elements are the same (0 or
                            1).

2

: if three elements have a value equal
                            to 0 and one element has value equal to 1 or vice versa.

0

: if two element have a value equal to 0
                            and two elements have a value equal to 1.

int length()

: Returns the size of the array.

You are allowed to call

query()

2 * n times

at
                most where n is equal to

ArrayReader.length()

.

Return

any

index of the most frequent value in

nums

, in
                case of tie, return -1.

Follow up:

What is the minimum number of calls needed to find the
                majority element?

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1]

Output:

5

Explanation:

The following calls to the API
reader.length() // returns 8 because there are 8 elements in the hidden array.
reader.query(0,1,2,3) // returns 2 this is a query that compares the elements nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3]
// Three elements have a value equal to 0 and one element has value equal to 1 or viceversa.
reader.query(4,5,6,7) // returns 4 because nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7] have the same value.
we can infer that the most frequent value is found in the last 4 elements.
Index 2, 4, 6, 7 is also a correct answer.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [0,0,1,1,0]

Output:

0

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

Output:

-1

## 1540-can-convert-string-in-k-moves.md

# 1540. Can Convert String in K Moves

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1540.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1540.html)

**Companies:** infosys

## Description

Given two strings

s

and

t

, your goal is to
            convert

s

into

t

in

k

moves
            or less.

During the

i

th

(

1 <=
                i <= k

)

move you can:

Choose any index

j

(1-indexed) from

s

,
                    such that

1 <= j <= s.length

and

j

has
                    not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index

i

times.

Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping
                around so that

'z'

becomes

'a'

). Shifting a
                character by

i

means applying the shift
                operations

i

times.

Remember that any index

j

can be picked at most once.

Return

true

if it's possible to convert

s

into

t

in
                no more than

k

moves, otherwise
                return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "input", t = "ouput", k = 9

Output:

true

Explanation:

In the 6th move, we shift 'i' 6 times to get 'o'. And in the 7th move we shift 'n' to get 'u'.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "abc", t = "bcd", k = 10

Output:

false

Explanation:

We need to shift each character in s one time to convert it into t. We can shift 'a' to 'b' during the 1st move. However, there is no way to shift the other characters in the remaining moves to obtain t from s.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "aab", t = "bbb", k = 27

Output:

true

Explanation:

In the 1st move, we shift the first 'a' 1 time to get 'b'. In the 27th move, we shift the second 'a' 27 times to get 'b'.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5

0 <= k <= 10^9

s

,

t

contain only lowercase English letters.

# 1541. Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1541.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1541.html)

**Companies:** CasaOne

## Description

Given a parentheses string

s

containing only the characters

'('

and

')'

. A parentheses string is

balanced

if:

Any left parenthesis

'('

must have a corresponding two
                    consecutive right parenthesis

'))'

.

Left parenthesis

'('

must go before the corresponding two consecutive
                    right parenthesis

'))'

.

For example,

"())"

,

"())(())))"

and

"(())())))"

are balanced,

")()"

,

"()))"

and

"(()))"

are not balanced.

You can insert the characters '(' and ')' at any position of the string to balance it
                if needed.

Return

the minimum number of insertions

needed to make

s

balanced.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "(()))"

Output:

1

Explanation:

The second '(' has two matching '))', but the first '(' has only ')' matching. We need to to add one more ')' at the end of the string to be "(())))" which is balanced.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "())"

Output:

0

Explanation:

The string is already balanced.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "))())("

Output:

Explanation:

Add 12 ')' to balance the string.

Example 5:

Input:

s = ")))))))"

Output:

5

Explanation:

Add 4 '(' at the beginning of the string and one ')' at the end. The string becomes "(((())))))))".

Constraints:

# 1544. Make The String Great

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1544.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1544.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a string

s

of lower and upper case English letters.

A good string is a string which doesn't have

two adjacent
                characters

s[i]

and

s[i + 1]

where:

0 <= i <= s.length - 2

s[i]

is a lower-case letter and

s[i + 1]

is the same
                    letter but in upper-case or

vice-versa

.

To make the string good, you can choose

two adjacent

characters that
                make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string
                becomes good.

Return

the string

after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be
                unique under the given constraints.

Notice

that an empty string is also good.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "leEeetcode"

Output:

"leetcode"

Explanation:

In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "abBAcC"

Output:

""

Explanation:

We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""
"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""

Example 3:

Input:

s = "s"

Output:

"s"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100

s

contains only lower and upper case English letters.

# 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1547.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1547.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a wooden stick of length

n

units. The stick is labelled from

0

to

n

. For example, a stick of length

6

is
            labelled as follows:

Given an integer array

cuts

where

cuts[i]

denotes
                a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you
                wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum
                of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks
                (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please
                refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return

the minimum total cost

of the cuts.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]

Output:

16

Explanation:

Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:

The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

Example 2:

Input:

n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]

Output:

22

Explanation:

If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.
There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10^6

1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)

1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1

All the integers in

cuts

array are

distinct

# 1548. The Most Similar Path in a Graph

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1548.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1548.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

We have

n

cities and

m

bi-directional

roads

where

roads[i] = [a

i

, b

i

]

connects city

a

i

with city

b

i

. Each city has a name
            consisting of exactly 3 upper-case English letters given in the string array

names

. Starting at any city

x

, you can reach any city

y

where

y != x

(i.e. the cities and the roads are forming an
            undirected connected graph).

You will be given a string array

targetPath

. You should find a path in
                the graph of the

same length

and with the

minimum edit
                    distance

to

targetPath

.

You need to return

the order of the nodes in the path with the minimum edit
                distance

, The path should be of the same length of

targetPath

and
                should be valid (i.e. there should be a direct road between

ans[i]

and

ans[i + 1]

). If there are multiple answers return any one of them.

The

edit distance

is defined as follows:

Follow-up:

If each node can be visited only once in the path, What
                should you change in your solution?

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5, roads = [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,4]], names = ["ATL","PEK","LAX","DXB","HND"], targetPath = ["ATL","DXB","HND","LAX"]

Output:

[0,2,4,2]

Explanation:

[0,2,4,2], [0,3,0,2] and [0,3,1,2] are accepted answers.
[0,2,4,2] is equivalent to ["ATL","LAX","HND","LAX"] which has edit distance = 1 with targetPath.
[0,3,0,2] is equivalent to ["ATL","DXB","ATL","LAX"] which has edit distance = 1 with targetPath.
[0,3,1,2] is equivalent to ["ATL","DXB","PEK","LAX"] which has edit distance = 1 with targetPath.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 4, roads = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,2]], names = ["ATL","PEK","LAX","DXB"], targetPath = ["ABC","DEF","GHI","JKL","MNO","PQR","STU","VWX"]

Output:

[0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]

Explanation:

Any path in this graph has edit distance = 8 with targetPath.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 6, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], names = ["ATL","PEK","LAX","ATL","DXB","HND"], targetPath = ["ATL","DXB","HND","DXB","ATL","LAX","PEK"]

Output:

[3,4,5,4,3,2,1]

Explanation:

[3,4,5,4,3,2,1] is the only path with edit distance = 0 with targetPath.
It's equivalent to ["ATL","DXB","HND","DXB","ATL","LAX","PEK"]

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100

m == roads.length

n - 1 <= m <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)

0 <= a

i

, b

i

<= n - 1

a

i

!= b

i

The graph is guaranteed to be

connected

and each pair of nodes
                    may have

at most one

direct road.

names.length == n

names[i].length == 3

names[i]

consists of upper-case English letters.

# 1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1551.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1551.html)

**Companies:** Brillio

## Description

You have an array

arr

of length

n

where

arr[i] = (2
            * i) + 1

for all valid values of

i

(i.e.

0 <= i <
            n

).

In one operation, you can select two indices

x

and

y

where

0 <= x, y < n

and subtract

1

from

arr[x]

and add

1

to

arr[y]

(i.e. perform

arr[x] -=1

and

arr[y] += 1

). The goal is to make
                all the elements of the array

equal

. It is

guaranteed

that all the elements of the array can be made equal
                using some operations.

Given an integer

n

, the length of the array. Return

the minimum
                number of operations

# 1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1553.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1553.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There are

n

oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these
            oranges every day as follows:

Eat one orange.

If the number of remaining oranges (

n

) is divisible by 2 then you
                    can eat  n/2 oranges.

If the number of remaining oranges (

n

) is divisible by 3 then
                    you can eat  2*(n/3) oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Return the minimum number of days to eat

n

oranges.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 10

Output:

4

Explanation:

You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1.
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 6

Output:

3

Explanation:

You have 6 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).
Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.

Example 3:

## 1557-minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes.md

# 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1557.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1557.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a

directed acyclic graph

, with

n

vertices
            numbered from

0

to

n-1

, and an array

edges

where

edges[i]
                = [from

i

, to

i

]

represents a directed edge from
            node

from

i

to node

to

i

.

Find

the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are
                reachable

. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]

Output:

[0,3]

Explanation:

It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]

Output:

[0,2,3]

Explanation:

Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)

edges[i].length == 2

0 <= from

i,

to

i

# 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1559.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1559.html)

**Companies:** Nutanix

## Description

Given a 2D array of characters

grid

of size

m x
            n

, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the

same
            value

in

grid

.

A cycle is a path of

length 4 or more

in the grid that
                starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the
                cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if
                it has the

same value

of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example,
                the cycle

(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)

is invalid because
                from

(1, 2)

we visited

(1, 1)

which
                was the last visited cell.

Return

true

if any cycle of the same value exists
                in

grid

, otherwise, return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [["a","a","a","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","a","a","a"]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

There are two valid cycles shown in different colors in the image below:

Example 2:

Input:

grid = [["c","c","c","a"],["c","d","c","c"],["c","c","e","c"],["f","c","c","c"]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

There is only one valid cycle highlighted in the image below:

Example 3:

Input:

grid = [["a","b","b"],["b","z","b"],["b","b","a"]]

Output:

false

Constraints:

m == grid.length

n == grid[i].length

1 <= m <= 500

1 <= n <= 500

grid

consists only of lowercase English letters.

## 1560-most-visited-sector-in-a-circular-track.md

# 1560. Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1560.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1560.html)

**Companies:** Expedia

## Description

Given an integer

n

and an integer array

rounds

. We have
            a circular track which consists of

n

sectors labeled from

1

to

n

. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of

m

rounds. The

i

th

round starts at sector

rounds[i - 1]

and ends at sector

rounds[i]

. For example, round
            1 starts at sector

rounds[0]

and ends at sector

rounds[1]

Return

an array of the most visited sectors

sorted in

ascending

order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the
                counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]

Output:

[1,2]

Explanation:

The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]

Output:

[2]

Example 3:

Input:

n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7]

Output:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100

1 <= m <= 100

rounds.length == m + 1

1 <= rounds[i] <= n

rounds[i] != rounds[i + 1]

## Description

There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will
            take piles of coins as follows:

In each step, you will choose

any

3 piles of coins (not
                    necessarily consecutive).

Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number
                    of coins.

You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.

Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.

Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.

Given an array of integers

piles

where

piles[i]

is the
                number of coins in the

## 1563-stone-game-v.md

# 1563. Stone Game V

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1563.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1563.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

There are several stones

arranged in a row

, and each stone has
            an associated value which is an integer given in the
            array

stoneValue

.

In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into

two non-empty
                rows

(i.e. left row and right row), then Bob calculates the value of each
                row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away
                the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value
                of the remaining row. If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide
                which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the remaining row.

The game ends when there is only

one stone remaining

. Alice's is
                initially

zero

.

Return

the maximum score that Alice can obtain

.

Example 1:

Input:

stoneValue = [6,2,3,4,5,5]

Output:

18

Explanation:

In the first round, Alice divides the row to [6,2,3], [4,5,5]. The left row has the value 11 and the right row has value 14. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 11.
In the second round Alice divides the row to [6], [2,3]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).
The last round Alice has only one choice to divide the row which is [2], [3]. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 18 (16 + 2). The game ends because only one stone is remaining in the row.

Example 2:

Input:

stoneValue = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]

Output:

28

Example 3:

Input:

stoneValue = [4]

Output:

# 1564. Put Boxes Into the Warehouse I

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1564.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1564.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given two arrays of positive integers

boxes

and

warehouse

representing
            the heights of some boxes of unit width, and the heights of

n

rooms
            in a warehouse, respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled
            from

0

to

n - 1

from left to right where

warehouse[i]

(0-indexed) is the height of
            the

i

th

room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:

Boxes can't be piled up.

You can rearrange the order of the boxes.

Boxes can only be pushed into the warehouse from left to right only.

If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a
                    box, then the box will be stopped before that room, so are the boxes behind
                    it.

Return

the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.

Example 1:

Input:

boxes = [4,3,4,1], warehouse = [5,3,3,4,1]

Output:

3

Explanation:

We can first put the box of height 1 in room 4. Then we can put the box of height 3 in either of the 3 rooms 1, 2, or 3. Lastly, we can put one box of height 4 in room 0.
There is no way we can fit all 4 boxes in the warehouse.

Example 2:

Input:

boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]

Output:

3

Explanation:

Notice that it's not possible to put the box of height 4 into the warehouse since it cannot pass the first room of height 3.
Also, for the last two rooms, 2 and 3, only boxes of height 1 can fit.
We can fit 3 boxes maximum as shown above. The yellow box can also be put in room 2 instead.
Swapping the orange and green boxes is also valid, or swapping one of them with the red box.

Example 3:

Input:

boxes = [1,2,3], warehouse = [1,2,3,4]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Since the first room in the warehouse is of height 1, we can only put boxes of height 1.

Example 4:

Input:

boxes = [4,5,6], warehouse = [3,3,3,3,3]

Output:

0

Constraints:

n == warehouse.length

1 <= boxes.length, warehouse.length <= 10^5

1 <= boxes[i], warehouse[i] <= 10^9

## 1566-detect-pattern-of-length-m-repeated-k-or-more-times.md

# 1566. Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1566.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1566.html)

**Companies:** HRT

## Description

Given an array of positive integers

arr

,  find a pattern of length

m

that is repeated

k

or more times.

A

pattern

is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of
                one or more values, repeated multiple times

consecutively

without
                overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

Return

true

if there exists a pattern of length

m

that
                is repeated

k

or more times, otherwise return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3

Output:

true

Explanation:

The pattern

(4)

of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2

Output:

true

Explanation:

The pattern

(1,2)

of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. Another valid pattern

(2,1) is

also repeated 2 times.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3

Output:

false

Explanation:

The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.

Example 4:

Input:

arr = [1,2,3,1,2], m = 2, k = 2

Output:

false

Explanation:

Notice that the pattern (1,2) exists twice but not consecutively, so it doesn't count.

Example 5:

Input:

arr = [2,2,2,2], m = 2, k = 3

Output:

false

Explanation:

The only pattern of length 2 is (2,2) however it's repeated only twice. Notice that we do not count overlapping repetitions.

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 100

1 <= arr[i] <= 100

1 <= m <= 100

2 <= k <= 100

# 1567. Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1567.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1567.html)

**Companies:** Arcesium

## Description

Given an array of integers

nums, find

the maximum length of a
            subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.

A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of
                that array.

Return

the maximum length of a subarray with positive product

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,-2,-3,4]

Output:

4

Explanation:

The array nums already has a positive product of 24.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [0,1,-2,-3,-4]

Output:

3

Explanation:

The longest subarray with positive product is [1,-2,-3] which has a product of 6.

## 1569-number-of-ways-to-reorder-array-to-get-same-bst.md

# 1569. Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1569.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1569.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an array

nums

that represents a permutation of integers from

1

to

n

.
            We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements
            of

nums

in order into an initially empty BST. Find the
            number of different ways to reorder

nums

so that the constructed BST is
            identical to that formed from the original array

nums

.

For example, given

nums = [2,1,3]

, we will have 2 as the root, 1 as
                a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array

[2,3,1]

also
                yields the same BST but

[3,2,1]

yields a different BST.

Return

the number of ways to reorder

nums

such
                that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from

nums

.

Since the answer may be very large,

return it
                modulo

10^9 + 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2,1,3]

Output:

1

Explanation:

We can reorder nums to be [2,3,1] which will yield the same BST. There are no other ways to reorder nums which will yield the same BST.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output:

5

Explanation:

The following 5 arrays will yield the same BST:
[3,1,2,4,5]
[3,1,4,2,5]
[3,1,4,5,2]
[3,4,1,2,5]
[3,4,1,5,2]

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3]

Output:

0

Explanation:

There are no other orderings of nums that will yield the same BST.

Example 4:

Input:

nums = [3,1,2,5,4,6]

Output:

19

Example 5:

Input:

nums = [9,4,2,1,3,6,5,7,8,14,11,10,12,13,16,15,17,18]

Output:

216212978

Explanation:

The number of ways to reorder nums to get the same BST is 3216212999. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives 216212978.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000

1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length

All integers in

nums

are

distinct

Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [5,4,3,2,1]

Output:

4

Explanation:

Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [1,2,3]

Output:

0

Explanation:

The array is already non-decreasing. We do not need to remove any elements.

Example 4:

Input:

arr = [1]

Output:

0

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

# 1575. Count All Possible Routes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1575.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1575.html)

**Companies:** tsys

## Description

You are given an array of

distinct

positive integers locations where

locations[i]

represents the position of city

i

. You are also
            given integers

start

,

finish

and

fuel

representing
            the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city

i

, you can pick any
                city

j

such that

j != i

and

0
                    <= j < locations.length

and move to city

j

. Moving
                from city

i

to city

j

reduces the amount of fuel you have
                by

|locations[i] - locations[j]|

. Please notice that

|x|

denotes
                the absolute value of

x

.

Notice that

fuel

cannot

become negative at
                any point in time, and that you are

allowed

to visit any city more
                than once (including

start

and

finish

).

Return

the count of all possible routes
                from

start

to

finish

.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo

10^9 +
                7

.

Example 1:

Input:

locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5

Output:

4

Explanation:

The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

Example 2:

Input:

locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6

Output:

5

Explanation:

The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5

Example 3:

Input:

locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3

Output:

0

Explanation:

It's impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.

Example 4:

Input:

locations = [2,1,5], start = 0, finish = 0, fuel = 3

Output:

2

Explanation:

There are two possible routes, 0 and 0 -> 1 -> 0.

Example 5:

Input:

locations = [1,2,3], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 40

Output:

615088286

Explanation:

The total number of possible routes is 2615088300. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 615088286.

Constraints:

2 <= locations.length <= 100

1 <= locations[i] <= 10^9

All integers
                    in

locations

are

distinct

.

0 <= start, finish < locations.length

1 <= fuel <= 200

## Description

Given a string

s

containing only lower case
            English letters and the '?' character, convert

all

the '?'
            characters into lower case letters such that the final string does not contain any

consecutive repeating

characters. You

cannot

modify the non '?' characters.

It is

guaranteed

that there are no consecutive repeating characters
                in the given string

except

for '?'.

Return the final string after all the conversions (possibly zero) have been made. If
                there is more than one solution, return any of them. It can be shown that an
                answer is always possible with the given constraints.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "?zs"

Output:

"azs"

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1577.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1577.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given two arrays of integers

nums1

and

nums2

, return
            the number of triplets formed (type 1 and type 2) under the following rules:

Type 1: Triplet (i, j, k) if

nums1[i]

2

== nums2[j] *
                    nums2[k]

where

0 <= i < nums1.length

and

## 1578-minimum-deletion-cost-to-avoid-repeating-letters.md

# 1578. Minimum Deletion Cost to Avoid Repeating Letters

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1578.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1578.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Given a string

s

and an array of integers

cost

where

cost[i]

is the cost of deleting the character

i

in

s

.

Return the minimum cost of deletions such that there are no two identical
                letters next to each other.

Notice that you will delete the chosen characters at the same time, in other words,
                after deleting a character, the costs of deleting other characters will not
                change.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "abaac", cost = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output:

3

Explanation:

Delete the letter "a" with cost 3 to get "abac" (String without two identical letters next to each other).

Example 2:

Input:

s = "abc", cost = [1,2,3]

Output:

0

Explanation:

You don't need to delete any character because there are no identical letters next to each other.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "aabaa", cost = [1,2,3,4,1]

Output:

2

Explanation:

Delete the first and the last character, getting the string ("aba").

Constraints:

## 1579-remove-max-number-of-edges-to-keep-graph-fully-traversable.md

# 1579. Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1579.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1579.html)

**Companies:** Uber

## Description

Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of

n

nodes and 3
            types of edges:

Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.

Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.

Type 3: Can by traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array

edges

where

edges[i] =
                [type

i

, u

i

, v

i

]

represents a
                bidirectional edge of type

type

i

between nodes

u

i

and

v

i

,
                find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges,
                the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully
                traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other
                nodes.

Return

the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return

-1

if it's impossible for the graph to be fully traversed by Alice and Bob.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes. Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1. Therefore it's impossible to make the graph fully traversable.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, 3 * n * (n-1) / 2)

edges[i].length == 3

1 <= edges[i][0] <= 3

1 <= edges[i][1] < edges[i][2] <= n

## 1580-put-boxes-into-the-warehouse-ii.md

# 1580. Put Boxes Into the Warehouse II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1580.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1580.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

You are given two arrays of positive integers,

boxes

and

warehouse

,
            representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of

n

rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled from

0

to

n - 1

from left to right where

warehouse[i]

(0-indexed) is
            the height of the

i

th

room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:

Boxes cannot be stacked.

You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.

Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from

either side

(left
                    or right)

If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box,
                    then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return

the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.

Example 1:

Input:

boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]

Output:

4

Explanation:

We can store the boxes in the following order:
1- Put the yellow box in room 2 from either the left or right side.
2- Put the orange box in room 3 from the right side.
3- Put the green box in room 1 from the left side.
4- Put the red box in room 0 from the left side.
Notice that there are other valid ways to put 4 boxes such as swapping the red and green boxes or the red and orange boxes.

Example 2:

Input:

boxes = [3,5,5,2], warehouse = [2,1,3,4,5]

Output:

3

Explanation:

It's not possible to put the two boxes of height 5 in the warehouse since there's only 1 room of height >= 5.
Other valid solutions are to put the green box in room 2 or to put the orange box first in room 2 before putting the green and red boxes.

Example 3:

Input:

boxes = [1,2,3], warehouse = [1,2,3,4]

Output:

3

Example 4:

Input:

boxes = [4,5,6], warehouse = [3,3,3,3,3]

Output:

                preferred than a friend later in the list. Friends in each list are denoted
                by integers from

0

to

n-1

.

All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list

pairs

, where

pairs[i] = [x

i

, y

i

]

denotes

x

i

is paired with

y

i

and

y

i

is paired with

x

i

.

However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend

x

is unhappy if

x

is paired with

y

and
                there exists a friend

u

who is paired with

v

but:

x

prefers

u

over

y

, and

u

prefers

x

over

v

.

Return

the number of unhappy friends

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, preferences = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0], [3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0]], pairs = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

Friend 1 is unhappy because:
- 1 is paired with 0 but prefers 3 over 0, and
- 3 prefers 1 over 2.
Friend 3 is unhappy because:
- 3 is paired with 2 but prefers 1 over 2, and
- 1 prefers 3 over 0.
Friends 0 and 2 are happy.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 2, preferences = [[1], [0]], pairs = [[1, 0]]

# 1585. Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1585.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1585.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given two strings

s

and

t

, you want to transform
            string

s

into string

t

using the following operation
            any number of times:

Choose a

non-empty

substring in

s

and
                    sort it in-place so the characters are in

ascending
                        order

.

For example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in

"1

4234

"

results
                in

"1

2344

"

.

Return

true

if

it is possible to transform string

s

into
                string

t

. Otherwise, return

false

.

A

substring

is a contiguous sequence of characters within a
                string.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "84532", t = "34852"

Output:

true

Explanation:

You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:
"84

53

2" (from index 2 to 3) -> "84

35

2"
"

843

52" (from index 0 to 2) -> "

348

52"

Example 2:

Input:

s = "34521", t = "23415"

Output:

true

Explanation:

You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:
"

3452

1" -> "

2345

1"
"234

51

" -> "234

15

"

Example 3:

Input:

s = "12345", t = "12435"

Output:

false

Example 4:

Input:

s = "1", t = "2"

Output:

false

Constraints:

## 1586-binary-search-tree-iterator-ii.md

# 1586. Binary Search Tree Iterator II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1586.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1586.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Implement the

BSTIterator

class that represents an iterator over the

in-order
                traversal

of a binary search tree (BST):

BSTIterator(TreeNode root)

Initializes an object of the

BSTIterator

class. The

root

of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The
                    pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element
                    in the BST.

boolean hasNext()

Returns

true

if there exists a
                    number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns

false

.

int next()

Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number
                    at the pointer.

boolean hasPrev()

Returns

true

if there exists a
                    number in the traversal to the left of the pointer, otherwise returns

false

.

int prev()

Moves the pointer to the left, then returns the number
                    at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first
                call to

next()

will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that

next()

and

prev()

calls will always be
                valid. That is, there will be at least a next/previous number in the in-order
                traversal when

next()

/

prev()

is called.

Follow up:

Could you solve the problem without precalculating the
                values of the tree?

Example 1:

Input

["BSTIterator", "next", "next", "prev", "next", "hasNext", "next", "next", "next", "hasNext", "hasPrev", "prev", "prev"]
[[[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null], [null]]

Output

[null, 3, 7, 3, 7, true, 9, 15, 20, false, true, 15, 9]

Explanation

// The underlined element is where the pointer currently is.
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator([7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]); // state is

[3, 7, 9, 15, 20]
bSTIterator.next(); // state becomes [

3

, 7, 9, 15, 20], return 3
bSTIterator.next(); // state becomes [3,

7

, 9, 15, 20], return 7

3

, 7, 9, 15, 20], return 3
bSTIterator.next(); // state becomes [3,

7

, 9, 15, 20], return 7
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return true
bSTIterator.next(); // state becomes [3, 7,

9

, 15, 20], return 9
bSTIterator.next(); // state becomes [3, 7, 9,

15

, 20], return 15
bSTIterator.next(); // state becomes [3, 7, 9, 15,

15

, 20], return 15
bSTIterator.prev(); // state becomes [3, 7,

9

, 15, 20], return 9

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range

[1, 10

5

]

.

0 <= Node.val <= 10

## Description

We have an array of integers,

nums

, and an array of

requests

where

requests[i] = [start

i

,
                end

i

]

. The

th

request asks for the sum of

nums[start

i

] + nums[start

i

+ 1] + ... + nums[end

i

- 1] + nums[end

i

]

. Both

start

i

and

end

i

are

0-indexed

.

Return

the maximum total sum of all requests

among all
                permutations

of

nums

.

Since the answer may be too large, return it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]

Output:

19

Explanation:

One permutation of nums is [2,1,3,4,5] with the following result:
requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8
requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 1 = 3
Total sum: 8 + 3 = 11.
A permutation with a higher total sum is [3,5,4,2,1] with the following result:
requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 5  = 8
Total sum: 11 + 8 = 19, which is the best that you can do.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], requests = [[0,1]]

Output:

11

Explanation:

A permutation with the max total sum is [6,5,4,3,2,1] with request sums [11].

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,10], requests = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,1]]

Output:

47

Explanation:

A permutation with the max total sum is [4,10,5,3,2,1] with request sums [19,18,10].

# 1590. Make Sum Divisible by P

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1590.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1590.html)

**Companies:** Amazom

## Description

Given an array of positive integers

nums

, remove the

smallest

subarray (possibly

empty

) such that the

sum

of the remaining elements is divisible by

p

. It is

not

allowed to remove the whole array.

Return

the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove,
                or

-1

if it's impossible

.

A

subarray

is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the
                array.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6

Output:

1

Explanation:

The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9

Output:

2

Explanation:

We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3], p = 3

Output:

0

Explanation:

Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.

Example 4:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3], p = 7

Output:

-1

Explanation:

There is no way to remove a subarray in order to get a sum divisible by 7.

Example 5:

Input:

nums = [1000000000,1000000000,1000000000], p = 3

Output:

# 1591. Strange Printer II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1591.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1591.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single
                    color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.

Once the printer has used a color for the above operation,

the same
                    color cannot be used again

.

You are given a

m x n

matrix

targetGrid

, where

targetGrid[row][col]

is the color in the position

(row, col)

of the grid.

Return

true

if it is possible to print the matrix

targetGrid

,

otherwise, return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

targetGrid = [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,1,1,1]]

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

targetGrid = [[1,1,1,1],[1,1,3,3],[1,1,3,4],[5,5,1,4]]

Output:

true

Example 3:

Input:

targetGrid = [[1,2,1],[2,1,2],[1,2,1]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

It is impossible to form targetGrid because it is not allowed to print the same color in different turns.

Example 4:

Input:

targetGrid = [[1,1,1],[3,1,3]]

Output:

false

Constraints:

m == targetGrid.length

n == targetGrid[i].length

# 1592. Rearrange Spaces Between Words

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1592.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1592.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given a string

text

of words that are placed among some number
            of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated
            by at least one space. It's guaranteed that

text

contains at least
                one word

.

Rearrange the spaces so that there is an

equal

number of spaces
                between every pair of adjacent words and that number is

maximized

.
                If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the

extra spaces at
                    the end

, meaning the returned string should be the same length as

text

.

Return

the string after rearranging the spaces

.

Example 1:

Input:

text = "  this   is  a sentence "

Output:

"this   is   a   sentence"

Explanation:

There are a total of 9 spaces and 4 words. We can evenly divide the 9 spaces between the words: 9 / (4-1) = 3 spaces.

Example 2:

Input:

text = " practice   makes   perfect"

Output:

"practice   makes   perfect "

Explanation:

There are a total of 7 spaces and 3 words. 7 / (3-1) = 3 spaces plus 1 extra space. We place this extra space at the end of the string.

Example 3:

Input:

text = "hello   world"

Output:

"hello   world"

Example 4:

Input:

text = "  walks  udp package   into  bar a"

Output:

"walks  udp  package  into  bar  a "

Example 5:

Input:

text = "a"

Output:

"a"

Constraints:

1 <= text.length <= 100

text

consists of lowercase English letters and

'
                    '

.

text

contains at least one word.

## 1593-split-a-string-into-the-max-number-of-unique-substrings.md

# 1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1593.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1593.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a string

s

,

return

the maximum number
            of unique substrings that the given string can be split into

.

You can split string

s

into any list of

non-empty
                substrings

, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original
                string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are

unique

.

A

substring

is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "ababccc"

Output:

5

Explanation

: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']. Splitting like ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'cc'] is not valid as you have 'a' and 'b' multiple times.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aba"

Output:

2

Explanation

: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'ba'].

Example 3:

Input:

s = "aa"

Output:

1

Explanation

: It is impossible to split the string any further.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 16

s

contains only lower case English letters.

# 1594. Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1594.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1594.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given a

rows x cols

matrix

grid

. Initially,
            you are located at the top-left corner

(0, 0)

, and in each
            step, you can only

move right or down

in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner

(0, 0)

and
                ending in the bottom-right corner

(rows - 1, cols - 1)

, find the
                path with the

maximum non-negative product

. The product of a
                path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the

maximum non-negative
                product

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

If
                the maximum product is

negative

return

-1

.

Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum
                product.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[-1,-2,-3],
               [-2,-3,-3],
               [-3,-3,-2]]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

It's not possible to get non-negative product in the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2), so return -1.

Example 2:

Input:

grid = [[

1

,-2,1],
               [

1

,

-2

,1],
               [3,

-4

,

1

]]

Output:

8

Explanation:

Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * 1 * -2 * -4 * 1 = 8).

Example 3:

Input:

grid = [[

1

, 3],
               [

0

,

-4

]]

Output:

0

Explanation:

Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * 0 * -4 = 0).

Example 4:

Input:

grid = [[

1

, 4,4,0],
               [

-2

, 0,0,1],
               [

1

,

-1

,

1

,

1

]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

Maximum non-negative product is in bold (1 * -2 * 1 * -1 * 1 * 1 = 2).

## 1595-minimum-cost-to-connect-two-groups-of-points.md

# 1595. Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1595.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1595.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given two groups of points where the first group has

size

1

points, the second group has

size

2

points, and

size

1

>=

size

2

.

The

cost

of the connection between any two points are given in an

size

1

x

size

2

matrix where

cost[i][j]

is the cost of connecting point

i

of the first group and
                point

j

of the second group. The groups are connected if

each
                    point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the
                    opposite group

. In other words, each point in the first group
                must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in
                the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return

the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups

.

Example 1:

Input:

cost = [[15, 96], [36, 2]]

Output:

17

Explanation

: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
This results in a total cost of 17.

Example 2:

Input:

cost = [[1, 3, 5], [4, 1, 1], [1, 5, 3]]

Output:

4

Explanation

: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
2--C
3--A
This results in a total cost of 4.
Note that there are multiple points connected to point 2 in the first group and point A in the second group. This does not matter as there is no limit to the number of points that can be connected. We only care about the minimum total cost.

Example 3:

Input:

cost = [[2, 5, 1], [3, 4, 7], [8, 1, 2], [6, 2, 4], [3, 8, 8]]

Output:

10

Constraints:

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

A

binary expression tree

is a kind of binary
            tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has
            either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands
            (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators

'+'

(addition),

'-'

(subtraction),

'*'

(multiplication), and

'/'

(division).

For each internal node with operator

o

, the

infix
                expression

that it represents is

(A o B)

, where

A

is the expression the left subtree represents and

B

is
                the expression the right subtree represents.

You are given a string

s

, an

infix expression

containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses

'('

and

')'

.

the

binary expression tree

, which its

in-order
                traversal

reproduce

s

.

Please note that order of operations applies
                in

s

.

That is, expressions in parentheses are
                evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and
                subtraction.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "2-3/(5*2)+1"

Output:

[+,-,1,2,/,null,null,null,null,3,*,null,null,5,2]

Example 2:

Input:

s = "3*4-2*5"

Output:

[-,*,*,3,4,2,5]

Example 3:

Input:

s = "1+2+3+4+5"

s

consists of digits and the characters

'+'

,

'-'

,

'*'

,

'/'

,

'('

, and

')'

## 1599-maximum-profit-of-operating-a-centennial-wheel.md

# 1599. Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1599.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1599.html)

**Companies:** peak6

## Description

You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has

four gondolas

,
            and each gondola has room for

up

to

four
                people

. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas

counterclockwise

,
            which costs you

runningCost

dollars.

You are given an array

customers

of length

n

where

customers[i]

is the number of new customers arriving just before the

i

th

rotation (0-indexed). This means you

must rotate

the wheel

i

times before

customers[i]

arrive. Each customer pays

boardingCost

dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the
                ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.

You can stop the wheel at any time, including

before

serving

all

customers

. If you
                decide to stop serving customers,

all subsequent rotations are free

in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more
                than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the
                rest will wait

for the next rotation

.

Return

the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your
                profit.

If there is

no scenario

where the profit is positive,
                return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6

Output:

3

Explanation:

The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.
3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.
The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.

Example 2:

Input:

customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4

Output:

7

Explanation:

1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $6 - 1 * $4 = $20.
2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.
3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.
4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.
5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.
6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.
7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 * $6 - 7 * $4 = $122.
The highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.

Example 3:

Input:

customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92

Output:

-1

Explanation:

1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 * $1 - 1 * $92 = -$89.
2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 2 * $92 = -$177.
3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 3 * $92 = -$269.
4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $1 - 4 * $92 = -$356.
5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 13 * $1 - 5 * $92 = -$447.
The profit was never positive, so return -1.

Explanation:

1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $3 - 1 * $8 = $4.
2. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 12 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $3 - 2 * $8 = $8.
3. 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $3 - 3 * $8 = $12.
4. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $3 - 4 * $8 = $16.
5. 7 customers arrive, 4 board and 17 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $3 - 5 * $8 = $20.
6. 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $3 - 6 * $8 = $24.
7. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 28 * $3 - 7 * $8 = $28.
8. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 32 * $3 - 8 * $8 = $32.
9. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 36 * $3 - 9 * $8 = $36.
10. 1 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 37 * $3 - 10 * $8 = $31.
The highest profit was $36 after rotating the wheel 9 times.

# 1600. Throne Inheritance

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1600.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1600.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once
            in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the
                first member. Let's define the recursive function

Successor(x,
                    curOrder)

, which given a person

x

and the inheritance order
                so far, returns who should be the next person after

x

in the order of
                inheritance.

Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder

For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice
                and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

In the beginning,

curOrder

will be

["king"]

.

Calling

Successor(king, curOrder)

will return Alice, so we append
                    to

curOrder

to get

["king", "Alice"]

.

Calling

Successor(Alice, curOrder)

will return Jack, so we append
                    to

curOrder

to get

["king", "Alice", "Jack"]

.

Calling

Successor(Jack, curOrder)

will return Bob, so we append to

curOrder

to get

["king", "Alice", "Jack", "Bob"]

.

Calling

Successor(Bob, curOrder)

will return

null

.
                    Thus the order of inheritance will be

["king", "Alice", "Jack",
                        "Bob"]

.

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

Implement the

ThroneInheritance

class:

ThroneInheritance(string kingName)

Initializes an object of the

ThroneInheritance

class. The name of the king is given as part of
                    the constructor.

void birth(string parentName, string childName)

Indicates that

parentName

gave birth to

childName

.

void death(string name)

Indicates the death of

name

.
                    The death of the person doesn't affect the

Successor

function nor
                    the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as
                    dead.

string[] getInheritanceOrder()

Returns a list representing the
                    current order of inheritance

excluding

dead people.

Example 1:

Input

["ThroneInheritance", "birth", "birth", "birth", "birth", "birth", "birth", "getInheritanceOrder", "death", "getInheritanceOrder"]
[["king"], ["king", "andy"], ["king", "bob"], ["king", "catherine"], ["andy", "matthew"], ["bob", "alex"], ["bob", "asha"], [null], ["bob"], [null]]

Output

[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, ["king", "andy", "matthew", "bob", "alex", "asha", "catherine"], null, ["king", "andy", "matthew", "alex", "asha", "catherine"]]

Explanation

ThroneInheritance t= new ThroneInheritance("king"); // order:

king

t.birth("king", "andy"); // order: king >

andy

t.birth("king", "bob"); // order: king > andy >

bob

t.birth("king", "catherine"); // order: king > andy > bob >

t.birth("andy", "matthew"); // order: king > andy >

t.getInheritanceOrder(); // return ["king", "andy", "matthew", "bob", "alex", "asha", "catherine"]
t.death("bob"); // order: king > andy > matthew >

# 1601. Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1601.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1601.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

We have

n

buildings numbered from

0

to

n - 1

.
            Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want
            to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array

requests

where

requests[i] =
                [from

i

, to

i

]

represents an employee's request to
                transfer from building

from

i

to building

to

i

.

All buildings are full

, so a list of requests is achievable only if
                for each building, the

net change in employee transfers is zero

.
                This means the number of employees

leaving

is

equal

to the number of employees

moving in

. For
                example if

n = 3

and two employees are leaving building

0

,
                one is leaving building

1

, and one is leaving building

2

,
                there should be two employees moving to building

0

, one employee moving
                to building

1

, and one employee moving to building

2

.

Return

the maximum number of achievable requests

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]

Output:

5

Explantion:

Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
From building 4 we don't have any requests.
We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]

Output:

3

Explantion:

Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
We can achieve all the requests.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]

Output:

4

## 1606-find-servers-that-handled-most-number-of-requests.md

# 1606. Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1606.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1606.html)

**Companies:** Wish

## Description

You have

k

servers numbered from

0

to

k-1

that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite
            computational capacity but

cannot handle more than one request at a
                time

. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific
            algorithm:

The

i

th

(0-indexed) request arrives.

If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).

If the

(i % k)

th

server is available, assign the request
                    to that server.

Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the
                    list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the

i

th

server is busy, try to assign the request to the

(i+1)

th

server, then the

(i+2)

th

server, and so on.

You are given a

strictly increasing

array

arrival

of
                positive integers, where

arrival[i]

represents the arrival time of the

i

th

request, and another array

load

, where

load[i]

represents the load of the

i

th

request
                (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the

busiest
                    server(s)

. A server is considered

busiest

if it
                handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.

Return

a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the

busiest
                server(s)

. You may return the IDs in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3]

Output:

[1]

Explanation:

All of the servers start out available.
The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

Example 2:

Input:

k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]

Output:

[0]

Explanation:

The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.

Example 3:

Input:

k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]

Output:

[0,1,2]

Explanation:

Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.

Example 4:

Input:

k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,8,9,10], load = [5,2,10,3,1,2,2]

Output:

[1]

Example 5:

Input:

k = 1, arrival = [1], load = [1]

## 1608-special-array-with-x-elements-greater-than-or-equal-x.md

# 1608. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1608.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1608.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given an array

nums

of non-negative integers.

nums

is considered

special

if there exists a number

x

such that
            there are

exactly

x

numbers in

nums

that are

greater than or equal to

x

.

Notice that

x

does not

have to be an element in

nums

.

Return

x

if the array is

special

, otherwise, return

-1

. It can be proven that if

nums

is special, the value
                for

x

is

unique

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [3,5]

Output:

2

Explanation:

There are 2 values (3 and 5) that are greater than or equal to 2.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [0,0]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

No numbers fit the criteria for x.
If x = 0, there should be 0 numbers >= x, but there are 2.
If x = 1, there should be 1 number >= x, but there are 0.
If x = 2, there should be 2 numbers >= x, but there are 0.
x cannot be greater since there are only 2 numbers in nums.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [0,4,3,0,4]

Output:

3

Explanation:

There are 3 values that are greater than or equal to 3.

Example 4:

Input:

nums = [3,6,7,7,0]

Output:

-1

## 1609-even-odd-tree.md

# 1609. Even Odd Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1609.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1609.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg

## Description

A binary tree is named

Even-Odd

if it meets the following
            conditions:

The root of the binary tree is at level index

0

, its children are
                    at level index

1

, their children are at level index

2

,
                    etc.

For every

even-indexed

level, all nodes at the level have

odd

integer values in

strictly increasing

order (from left to right).

For every

odd-indexed

level, all nodes at the level have

even

integer values in

strictly decreasing

order (from left to
                    right).

Given the

root

of a binary tree,

return

true

if the binary tree is

Even-Odd

, otherwise return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]

Output:

true

Explanation:

The node values on each level are:
Level 0: [1]
Level 1: [10,4]
Level 2: [3,7,9]
Level 3: [12,8,6,2]
Since levels 0 and 2 are all odd and increasing, and levels 1 and 3 are all even and decreasing, the tree is Even-Odd.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [5,4,2,3,3,7]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The node values on each level are:
Level 0: [5]
Level 1: [4,2]
Level 2: [3,3,7]
Node values in the level 2 must be in strictly increasing order, so the tree is not Even-Odd.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [5,9,1,3,5,7]

Output:

false

Explanation:

Node values in the level 1 should be even integers.

Example 4:

Input:

root = [1]

Output:

true

Example 5:

Input:

root = [11,8,6,1,3,9,11,30,20,18,16,12,10,4,2,17]

Output:

true

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range

[1, 10

5

]

.

1 <= Node.val <= 10

## 1610-maximum-number-of-visible-points.md

# 1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1610.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1610.html)

**Companies:** Nvidia

## Description

You are given an array

points

, an integer

angle

, and your

location

, where

location = [pos

x

, pos

y

]

and

points[i] = [x

i

, y

i

]

both denote

integral
                coordinates

on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You

cannot
                move

from your position, but you can

rotate

. In other
                words,

pos

x

and

pos

y

cannot be
                changed. Your field of view in

degrees

is represented by

angle

,
                determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let

d

be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your
                field of view is the

inclusive

range of angles

[d - angle/2,
                    d + angle/2]

.

Your browser does not support the video tag or this video format.

You can

see

some set of points if, for each point, the

angle

formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east
                direction from your position is

in your field of view

.

There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location,
                and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not
                obstruct your vision to other points.

Return

the maximum number of points you can see

.

Example 1:

Input:

points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]

Output:

3

Explanation:

The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is in front and in the same line of sight.

Example 2:

Input:

points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]

Output:

4

Explanation:

All points can be made visible in your field of view, including the one at your location.

Example 3:

Input:

points = [[1,0],[2,1]], angle = 13, location = [1,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

You can only see one of the two points, as shown above.

Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 10

5

points[i].length == 2

location.length == 2

# 1612. Check If Two Expression Trees are Equivalent

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1612.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1612.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

A

binary expression tree

is a kind of binary
            tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has
            either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands
            (variables), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators.
            In this problem, we only consider the

'+'

operator (i.e. addition).

You are given the roots of two binary expression trees,

root1

and

root2

.
                Return

true

if the two binary expression trees are equivalent

.
                Otherwise, return

false

.

Two binary expression trees are equivalent if they

evaluate to the same
                value

regardless of what the variables are set to.

Follow up:

What will you change in your solution if the tree also
                supports the

'-'

operator (i.e. subtraction)?

Example 1:

Input:

root1 = [x], root2 = [x]

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,b,c,a]

Output:

true

Explaination:

a + (b + c) == (b + c) + a

Example 3:

Input:

root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,b,d,a]

Output:

false

Explaination:

a + (b + c) != (b + d) + a

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees are equal, odd and, in the range

[1,
                    4999]

.

## Description

There is an infrastructure of

n

cities with some number of

roads

connecting these cities. Each

roads[i] = [a

i

, b

i

]

indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities

a

i

and

b

i

.

The

network rank

of

two different cities

is defined as the total number of

directly

connected roads to

either

city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is
                only counted

once

.

The

maximal network rank

of the infrastructure is the

maximum
                network rank

of all pairs of different cities.

Given the integer

n

and the array

roads

, return

the

maximal network rank

of the entire infrastructure

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]

Output:

4

Explanation:

The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]

Output:

5

Explanation:

There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.

a

into two strings:

a

prefix

and

a

suffix

where

a = a

prefix

+ a

suffix

,
            and splitting

b

into two strings:

b

prefix

and

b

suffix

where

b = b

prefix

+ b

suffix

.
            Check if

a

prefix

+ b

suffix

or

b

prefix

+ a

suffix

forms a palindrome.

When you split a string

s

into

s

prefix

and

s

suffix

, either

s

suffix

or

s

prefix

is allowed to be empty. For example, if

s =
                    "abc"

, then

"" + "abc"

,

"a" + "bc"

,

"ab"
                    + "c"

, and

"abc" + ""

are valid splits.

Return

true

if it is possible to form

a palindrome string,
                otherwise return

false

.

Notice

that

x + y

denotes the concatenation of
                strings

x

and

y

.

Example 1:

Input:

a = "x", b = "y"

Output:

true

Explaination:

If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:
a

prefix

= "", a

suffix

= "x"
b

prefix

= "", b

suffix

= "y"
Then, a

prefix

+ b

suffix

= "" + "y" = "y", which is a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input:

a = "abdef", b = "fecab"

Output:

true

Example 3:

Input:

a = "ulacfd", b = "jizalu"

Output:

true

Explaination:

Split them at index 3:
a

prefix

= "ula", a

suffix

= "cfd"
b

prefix

= "jiz", b

suffix

= "alu"
Then, a

prefix

+ b

suffix

= "ula" + "alu" = "ulaalu", which is a palindrome.

Example 4:

Input:

a = "xbdef", b = "xecab"

Output:

false

Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10

5

a.length == b.length

a

and

b

consist of lowercase English letters

# 1617. Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1617.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1617.html)

**Companies:** Codenation

## Description

There are

n

cities numbered from

1

to

n

. You
            are given an array

edges

of size

n-1

, where

edges[i] =
                [u

i

, v

i

]

represents a bidirectional edge between cities

u

i

and

v

i

. There exists a unique path
            between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a

tree

.

A

subtree

is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from
                every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only
                the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one
                subtree that is not present in the other.

For each

d

from

1

to

n-1

, find the number of
                subtrees in which the

maximum distance

between any two cities in
                the subtree is equal to

d

.

Return

an array of size

n-1

where
                the

d

th

element

(1-indexed)

is the number of subtrees in which the

maximum
                    distance

between any two cities is equal to

d

.

Notice

that the

distance

between the two
                cities is the number of edges in the path between them.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]

Output:

[3,4,0]

Explanation:

The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.
The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max distance of 2.
No subtree has two nodes where the max distance between them is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 2, edges = [[1,2]]

Output:

[1]

Example 3:

Input:

n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3]]

Output:

[2,1]

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 15

edges.length == n-1

edges[i].length == 2

1 <= u

i

, v

i

<= n

All pairs

(u

# 1618. Maximum Font to Fit a Sentence in a Screen

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1618.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1618.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given a string

text

. We want to display

text

on a
            screen of width

w

and height

h

. You can choose any font size
            from array

fonts

, which contains the available font sizes

in
                ascending order

.

You can use the

FontInfo

interface to get the width and height of any
                character at any available font size.

The

FontInfo

interface is defined as such:

interface FontInfo {
  // Returns the width of character ch on the screen using font size fontSize.
  // O(1) per call
  public int getWidth(int fontSize, char ch);

  // Returns the height of any character on the screen using font size fontSize.
  // O(1) per call
  public int getHeight(int fontSize);
}

The calculated width of

text

for some

fontSize

is the

sum

of every

getWidth(fontSize, text[i])

call for each

0 <= i < text.length

(

0-indexed

). The calculated
                height of

text

for some

fontSize

is

getHeight(fontSize)

.
                Note that

text

is displayed on a

single line

.

It is guaranteed that

FontInfo

will return the same value if you call

getHeight

or

getWidth

with the same parameters.

It is also guaranteed that for any font size

fontSize

and any character

ch

:

getHeight(fontSize) <= getHeight(fontSize+1)

getWidth(fontSize, ch) <= getWidth(fontSize+1, ch)

Return

the maximum font size you can use to display

text

on
                the screen

. If

text

cannot fit on the display with any font size,
                return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

text = "helloworld", w = 80, h = 20, fonts = [6,8,10,12,14,16,18,24,36]

Output:

6

Example 2:

Input:

text = "leetcode", w = 1000, h = 50, fonts = [1,2,4]

Output:

4

Example 3:

Input:

text = "easyquestion", w = 100, h = 100, fonts = [10,15,20,25]

Output:

# 1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1620.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1620.html)

**Companies:** peak6

## Description

You are given an array of network towers

towers

and an integer

radius

,
            where

towers[i] = [x

i

, y

i

, q

i

]

denotes the

i

th

network tower with location

(x

i

,
                y

i

)

and quality factor

q

i

. All the
            coordinates are

integral coordinates

on the X-Y plane, and the distance
            between two coordinates is the

Euclidean distance

.

The integer

radius

denotes the

maximum distance

in
                which the tower is

reachable

. The tower is

reachable

if the distance is less than or equal to

radius

. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the
                tower is

not reachable

.

The signal quality of the

i

th

tower at a coordinate

(x,
                y)

is calculated with the formula

âq

i

/ (1 + d)â

,
                where

d

is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The

network quality

at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities
                from all the

reachable

towers.

Return

the integral coordinate where the

network quality

is
                maximum

. If there are multiple coordinates with the same

network
                quality

, return

the lexicographically minimum coordinate

.

Note:

A coordinate

(x1, y1)

is lexicographically smaller than

(x2,
                    y2)

if either

x1 < x2

or

x1 == x2

and

y1
                    < y2

.

âvalâ

is the greatest integer less than or equal to

val

(the floor function).

Example 1:

Input:

towers = [[1,2,5],[2,1,7],[3,1,9]], radius = 2

Output:

[2,1]

Explanation:

At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13
- Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in â7 / (1 + sqrt(0)â = â7â = 7
- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in â5 / (1 + sqrt(2)â = â2.07â = 2
- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in â9 / (1 + sqrt(1)â = â4.5â = 4
No other coordinate has higher quality.

Example 2:

Input:

towers = [[23,11,21]], radius = 9

Output:

[23,11]

Example 3:

Input:

towers = [[1,2,13],[2,1,7],[0,1,9]], radius = 2

Output:

[1,2]

Example 4:

Input:

towers = [[2,1,9],[0,1,9]], radius = 2

Output:

[0,1]

Explanation:

Both (0, 1) and (2, 1) are optimal in terms of quality but (0, 1) is lexicograpically minimal.

Constraints:

1 <= towers.length <= 50

towers[i].length == 3

0 <= x

## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

SchoolA

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school A.
All student_name are distinct.

Table:

SchoolB

student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school B.
All student_name are distinct.

Table:

SchoolC

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school C.
All student_name are distinct.

There is a country with three schools, where each student is enrolled in

exactly
                one

school. The country is joining a competition and wants to select one
                student from each school to represent the country such that:

member_A

is selected from

SchoolA

,

member_B

is selected from

SchoolB

,

member_C

is selected from

SchoolC

, and

The selected students' names and IDs are pairwise distinct (i.e. no two students
                    share the same name, and no two students share the same ID).

Write an SQL query to find all the possible triplets representing the country under
                the given constraints.

Return the result table in

any order

.

The query result format is in the following example.

SchoolA

table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
+------------+--------------+

SchoolB

table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 3          | Tom          |
+------------+--------------+

SchoolC

table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 3          | Tom          |
| 2          | Jerry        |
| 10         | Alice        |
+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+----------+----------+----------+
| member_A | member_B | member_C |
+----------+----------+----------+
| Alice    | Tom      | Jerry    |
| Bob      | Tom      | Alice    |
+----------+----------+----------+
Let us see all the possible triplets.
- (Alice, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.
- (Alice, Tom, Jerry) --> Valid triplet.
- (Alice, Tom, Alice) --> Rejected because member_A and member_C have the same name.
- (Bob, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.

## 1625-lexicographically-smallest-string-after-applying-operations.md

# 1625. Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1625.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1625.html)

## Description

You are given a string

s

of

even length

consisting of
            digits from

0

to

9

, and two integers

a

and

b

.

You can apply either of the following two operations any number of times and in any
                order on

s

:

Add

a

to all odd indices of

s

(0-indexed)

. Digits post

9

are cycled back to

0

. For example, if

s = "3456"

and

a = 5

,

s

becomes

"3951"

.

Rotate

s

to the right by

b

positions. For example, if

s = "3456"

and

b = 1

,

s

becomes

"6345"

.

Return

the

lexicographically smallest

string you can obtain by
                applying the above operations any number of times on

s

.

A string

a

is lexicographically smaller than a string

b

(of
                the same length) if in the first position where

a

and

b

differ, string

a

has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than
                the corresponding letter in

b

. For example,

"0158"

is
                lexicographically smaller than

"0190"

because the first position they
                differ is at the third letter, and

'5'

comes before

'9'

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "5525", a = 9, b = 2

Output:

"2050"

Explanation:

We can apply the following operations:
Start:  "5525"
Rotate: "2555"
Add:    "2454"
Add:    "2353"
Rotate: "5323"
Add:    "5222"
âââââââAdd:    "5121"
âââââââRotate: "2151"
âââââââAdd:    "2050"ââââââââââââ
There is no way to obtain a string that is lexicographically smaller then "2050".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "74", a = 5, b = 1

Output:

"24"

Explanation:

We can apply the following operations:
Start:  "74"
Rotate: "47"
âââââââAdd:    "42"
âââââââRotate: "24"ââââââââââââ
There is no way to obtain a string that is lexicographically smaller then "24".

Example 3:

Input:

s = "0011", a = 4, b = 2

Output:

"0011"

Explanation:

There are no sequence of operations that will give us a lexicographically smaller string than "0011".

Example 4:

Input:

s = "43987654", a = 7, b = 3

Output:

"00553311"

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 100

s.length

is even.

s

consists of digits from

0

to

9

only.

1 <= a <= 9

1 <= b <= s.length - 1

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1626.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1626.html)

**Companies:** Morgan Stanley

## Description

You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to
            choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the

sum

of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have

conflicts

. A

conflict

exists if a younger player has a

strictly
                    higher

score than an older player. A conflict does

not

occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists,

scores

and

ages

, where each

scores[i]

and

ages[i]

represents the score and age of the

i

th

player, respectively, return

the highest overall
                    score of all possible basketball teams

.

Example 1:

Input:

scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output:

34

Explanation:

You can choose all the players.

Example 2:

Input:

scores = [4,5,6,5], ages = [2,1,2,1]

Output:

16

Explanation:

It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple people of the same age.

## 1627-graph-connectivity-with-threshold.md

# 1627. Graph Connectivity With Threshold

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1627.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1627.html)

**Companies:** Trexquant

## Description

We have

n

cities labeled from

1

to

n

. Two
            different cities with labels

x

and

y

are directly connected by
            a bidirectional road if and only if

x

and

y

share a common
            divisor

strictly greater

than some

threshold

. More
            formally, cities with labels

x

and

y

have a road between them
            if there exists an integer

z

such that all of the following are true:

x % z == 0

,

y % z == 0

, and

z > threshold

.

Given the two integers,

n

and

threshold

, and an array of

queries

, you must determine for each

queries[i] = [a

i

,
                    b

i

]

if cities

a

i

and

b

i

are connected (i.e. there is some path between them).

Return

an array

answer

, where

answer.length ==
                queries.length

and

answer[i]

is

true

if for the

i

th

query,
                there is a path between

a

i

and

b

i

, or

answer[i]

is

false

if there is no path.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]

Output:

[false,false,true]

Explanation:

The divisors for each number:
1:   1
2:   1, 2
3:   1,

3

4:   1, 2,

4

5:   1,

5

6:   1, 2,

3

,

6

Using the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the
only ones directly connected. The result of each query:
[1,4]   1 is not connected to 4
[2,5]   2 is not connected to 5
[3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6

Example 2:

Input:

n = 6, threshold = 0, queries = [[4,5],[3,4],[3,2],[2,6],[1,3]]

Output:

[true,true,true,true,true]

Explanation:

The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,
all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

Output:

[false,false,false,false,false]

Explanation:

Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.
Please notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10

4

0 <= threshold <= n

1 <= queries.length <= 10

5

queries[i].length == 2

## 1628-design-an-expression-tree-with-evaluate-function.md

# 1628. Design an Expression Tree With Evaluate Function

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1628.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1628.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Given the

postfix

tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return

the binary expression tree that represents this expression.

Postfix

notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the
                operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of
                the expression

4*(5-(2+7))

are represented in the array

postfix =
                    ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]

.

The class

Node

is an interface you should use to implement the binary
                expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the

evaluate

function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the

Node

class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define
                other classes to implement it if needed.

A

binary expression tree

is a kind of binary
                tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree
                has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to
                operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the
                operators

'+'

(addition),

'-'

(subtraction),

'*'

(multiplication), and

'/'

(division).

It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds

10

9

in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).

Follow up:

Could you design the expression tree such that it is more
                modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without
                making changes to your existing

evaluate

implementation?

Example 1:

Input:

s = ["3","4","+","2","*","7","/"]

Output:

2

Explanation:

this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression (

(3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.

Example 2:

Input:

s = ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]

Output:

-16

Explanation:

this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-

(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.

Example 3:

Input:

s = ["4","2","+","3","5","1","-","*","+"]

Output:

18

Example 4:

Input:

s = ["100","200","+","2","/","5","*","7","+"]

Output:

757

Constraints:

1 <= s.length < 100

s.length

is odd.

s

consists of numbers and the characters

'+'

,

'-'

,

'*'

, and

'/'

.

If

s[i]

is a number, its integer representation is no more than

10

5

.

It is guaranteed that

s

is a valid expression.

The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed

10

9

.

It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.

# 1629. Slowest Key

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1629.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1629.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of

n

keys, one at a time.

You are given a string

keysPressed

of length

n

, where

keysPressed[i]

was the

i

th

key pressed in the
                testing sequence, and a sorted list

releaseTimes

, where

releaseTimes[i]

was the time the

i

th

key was released. Both arrays are

0-indexed

. The

0

th

key was pressed at the
                time

0

, and every subsequent key was pressed at the

exact

time the previous key was released.

The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the

longest
                duration

. The

i

th

keypress had a

duration

of

releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1]

, and
                the

0

th

keypress had a duration of

releaseTimes[0]

.

Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and
                these multiple presses of the same key

may not

have had the same

duration

.

Return the key of the keypress that had the

longest duration

. If
                there are multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the
                keypresses.

Example 1:

Input:

releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = "cbcd"

Output:

"c"

Explanation:

The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).
Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29).
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49).
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).
The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20.
'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'.

Example 2:

Input:

releaseTimes = [12,23,36,46,62], keysPressed = "spuda"

Output:

"a"

Explanation:

The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 's' had a duration of 12.
Keypress for 'p' had a duration of 23 - 12 = 11.
Keypress for 'u' had a duration of 36 - 23 = 13.
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 46 - 36 = 10.
Keypress for 'a' had a duration of 62 - 46 = 16.
The longest of these was the keypress for 'a' with duration 16.

Constraints:

releaseTimes.length == n

keysPressed.length == n

2 <= n <= 1000

0 <= releaseTimes[i] <= 10

9

releaseTimes[i] < releaseTimes[i+1]

keysPressed

# 1630. Arithmetic Subarrays

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1630.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1630.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

A sequence of numbers is called

arithmetic

if it consists of at
            least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the
            same. More formally, a sequence

s

is arithmetic if and only if

s[i+1]
                - s[i] == s[1] - s[0]

for all valid

i

.

For example, these are

arithmetic

sequences:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9

The following sequence is not

arithmetic

:

1, 1, 2, 5, 7

You are given an array of

n

integers,

nums

, and two arrays
                of

m

integers each,

l

and

r

, representing the

m

range queries, where the

i

th

query is the
                range

[l[i], r[i]]

. All the arrays are

0-indexed

.

Return

a list of

boolean

elements

answer

, where

answer[i]

is

true

if the subarray

nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... ,
                    nums[r[i]]

can be

rearranged

to form an

arithmetic

sequence, and

false

otherwise.

Example 1:

Input:

nums =

[4,6,5,9,3,7]

, l =

[0,0,2]

, r =

[2,3,5]

Output:

[true,false,true]

Explanation:

In the 0

th

query, the subarray is [4,6,5]. This can be rearranged as [6,5,4], which is an arithmetic sequence.
In the 1

st

query, the subarray is [4,6,5,9]. This cannot be rearranged as an arithmetic sequence.
In the 2

nd

query, the subarray is

[5,9,3,7]. This

can be rearranged as

[3,5,7,9]

, which is an arithmetic sequence.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [-12,-9,-3,-12,-6,15,20,-25,-20,-15,-10], l = [0,1,6,4,8,7], r = [4,4,9,7,9,10]

heights

,
            a 2D array of size

rows x columns

, where

heights[row][col]

represents the height of cell

(row, col)

. You are situated in the top-left
            cell,

(0, 0)

, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell,

(rows-1,
                columns-1)

(i.e.,

0-indexed

). You can move

up

,

down

,

left

, or

right

, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum

                    column

, then:

If

p < q

then

rank(p) < rank(q)

If

p == q

then

rank(p) == rank(q)

If

p > q

then

rank(p) > rank(q)

The

rank

should be as

small

as possible.

It is guaranteed that

answer

is unique under the given rules.

Example 1:

Input:

matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]

Output:

[[1,2],[2,3]]

Explanation:

The rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.
The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.
The rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.
The rank of matrix[1][1] is 3 because matrix[1][1] > matrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] > matrix[1][0], and both matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0] are rank 2.

Example 2:

Input:

matrix = [[7,7],[7,7]]

Output:

[[1,1],[1,1]]

Example 3:

Input:

matrix = [[20,-21,14],[-19,4,19],[22,-47,24],[-19,4,19]]

Output:

[[4,2,3],[1,3,4],[5,1,6],[1,3,4]]

Example 4:

Input:

matrix = [[7,3,6],[1,4,5],[9,8,2]]

Output:

[[5,1,4],[1,2,3],[6,3,1]]

Constraints:

m == matrix.length

n == matrix[i].length

## 1634-add-two-polynomials-represented-as-linked-lists.md

# 1634. Add Two Polynomials Represented as Linked Lists

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1634.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1634.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node
            represents a term in a polynomial expression.

Each node has three attributes:

coefficient

: an integer representing the number multiplier of the
                    term. The coefficient of the term

9

x

4

is

9

.

power

: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term

9x

4

is

4

.

next

: a pointer to the next node in the list, or

null

if it is the last node of the list.

For example, the polynomial

5x

3

+ 4x - 7

is represented by
                the polynomial linked list illustrated below:

The polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must be in

strictly

descending order by its

power

value. Also,
                terms with a

coefficient

of

0

are omitted.

Given two polynomial linked list heads,

poly1

and

poly2

,
                add the polynomials together and return

the head of the sum of the
                    polynomials

.

PolyNode

format:

The input/output format is as a list of

n

nodes, where each node is
                represented as its

[coefficient, power]

. For example, the polynomial

5x

3

+ 4x - 7

would be represented as:

[[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]]

.

Example 1:

Input:

poly1 = [[1,1]], poly2 = [[1,0]]

Output:

[[1,1],[1,0]]

Explanation:

poly1 = x. poly2 = 1. The sum is x + 1.

Example 2:

Input:

poly1 = [[2,2],[4,1],[3,0]], poly2 = [[3,2],[-4,1],[-1,0]]

Output:

[[5,2],[2,0]]

Explanation:

poly1 = 2x

2

+ 4x + 3. poly2 = 3x

2

- 4x - 1. The sum is 5x

2

+ 2. Notice that we omit the "0x" term.

Example 3:

Input:

poly1 = [[1,2]], poly2 = [[-1,2]]

Output:

[]

Explanation:

The sum is 0. We return an empty list.

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 10

4

-10

9

<= PolyNode.coefficient <=
                    10

9

PolyNode.coefficient != 0

0 <= PolyNode.power <= 10

9

PolyNode.power > PolyNode.next.power

# 1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1638.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1638.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

Given two strings

s

and

t

, find the number of ways you can
            choose a non-empty substring of

s

and replace a

single
                character

by a different character such that the resulting substring is a
            substring of

t

. In other words, find the number of substrings in

s

that differ from some substring in

t

by

exactly

one character.

For example, the underlined substrings in

"

compute

r"

and

"

computa

tion"

only differ by the

'e'

/

'a'

, so this is a valid way.

Return

the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.

A

substring

is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aba", t = "baba"

Output:

6

Explanation:

The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:
("

a

ba", "

b

aba")
("

a

ba", "ba

b

a")
("ab

a

", "

b

aba")
("ab

a

", "ba

b

a")
("a

b

a", "b

a

ba")
("a

b

a", "bab

a

")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.

ââ

Example 2:

Input:

s = "ab", t = "bb"

Output:

3

Explanation:

The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:
("

a

b", "

b

b")
("

a

b", "b

b

")
("

ab

", "

bb

")
ââââThe underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "a", t = "a"

Output:

0

Example 4:

Input:

s = "abe", t = "bbc"

Output:

10

                following rules:

target

should be formed from left to right.

To form the

i

th

character (

0-indexed

)
                    of

target

, you can choose the

k

th

character
                    of the

j

th

string in

words

if

target[i]
                        = words[j][k]

.

Once you use the

k

th

character of the

j

th

string of

words

, you

can no
                        longer

use the

x

th

character of any string
                    in

words

where

x <= k

. In other words, all
                    characters to the left of or at index

k

become unusuable for every
                    string.

Repeat the process until you form the string

target

.

Notice

that you can use

multiple characters

from the

same string

in

words

provided the conditions
                above are met.

Return

the number of ways to form

target

from

words

. Since the answer may be too large, return it

modulo

10

# 1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1640.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1640.html)

**Companies:** codesignal

## Description

You are given an array of

distinct

integers

arr

and an
            array of integer arrays

pieces

, where the integers in

pieces

are

distinct

. Your goal is to form

arr

by concatenating
            the arrays in

pieces

in any order

. However, you are

not

allowed to reorder the integers in each array

pieces[i]

.

Return

true

if it is possible

to form the array

arr

from

pieces

. Otherwise, return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

Concatenate

[15]

then

[88]

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

Even though the numbers match, we cannot reorder pieces[0].

Example 4:

Input:

arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

Concatenate

[91]

then

[4,64]

then

[78]

Example 5:

Input:

arr = [1,3,5,7], pieces = [[2,4,6,8]]

Output:

false

Constraints:

1 <= pieces.length <= arr.length <= 100

sum(pieces[i].length) == arr.length

1 <= pieces[i].length <= arr.length

1 <= arr[i], pieces[i][j] <= 100

The integers in

arr

are

distinct

.

The integers in

pieces

are

distinct

(i.e.,
                    If we flatten pieces in a 1D array, all the integers in this array are
                    distinct).

# 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1642.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1642.html)

**Companies:** Google, Media.net

## Description

You are given an integer array

heights

representing the heights of
            buildings, some

bricks

, and some

ladders

.

You start your journey from building

0

and move to the next building by
                possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building

i

to building

i+1

(

0-indexed

),

If the current building's height is

greater than or equal

to
                    the next building's height, you do

not

need a ladder or bricks.

If the current building's height is

less than

the next building's height,
                    you can either use

one ladder

or

(h[i+1] - h[i])

bricks

.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given
                ladders and bricks optimally.

Example 1:

Input:

heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1

Output:

4

Explanation:

Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.

Example 2:

Input:

heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2

Output:

7

Example 3:

Input:

heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0

Output:

3

Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 10

5

1 <= heights[i] <= 10

6

0 <= bricks <= 10

9

0 <= ladders <= heights.length

# 1643. Kth Smallest Instructions

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1643.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1643.html)

**Companies:** HeavyWater

## Description

Bob is standing at cell

(0, 0)

, and he wants to reach

destination

:

(row, column)

. He can only travel

right

and

down

. You are going to help Bob by providing

instructions

for him to reach

destination

.

The

instructions

are represented as a string, where each character
                is either:

'H'

, meaning move horizontally (go

right

), or

'V'

, meaning move vertically (go

down

).

Multiple

instructions

will lead Bob to

destination

. For
                example, if

destination

is

(2, 3)

, both

"HHHVV"

and

"HVHVH"

are valid

instructions

.

However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number

k

, and he wants the

k

th

lexicographically smallest instructions

that will lead him to

destination

.

k

is

1-indexed

.

Given an integer array

destination

and an integer

k

, return

the

k

th

lexicographically smallest
                    instructions

that will take Bob to

destination

.

Example 1:

Input:

destination = [2,3], k = 1

Output:

"HHHVV"

Explanation:

All the instructions that reach (2, 3) in lexicographic order are as follows:
["HHHVV", "HHVHV", "HHVVH", "HVHHV", "HVHVH", "HVVHH", "VHHHV", "VHHVH", "VHVHH", "VVHHH"].

Example 2:

Input:

destination = [2,3], k = 2

Output:

"HHVHV"

Example 3:

Input:

destination = [2,3], k = 3

Output:

"HHVVH"

Constraints:

destination.length == 2

1 <= row, column <= 15

1 <= k <= nCr(row + column, row)

, where

nCr(a,
                    b)

# 1644. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1644.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1644.html)

**Companies:** LinkedIn, Microsoft

## Description

Given the

root

of a binary tree, return

the lowest common ancestor
            (LCA) of two given nodes,

p

and

q

. If either
            node

p

or

q

does not exist

in the tree,
            return

null

. All values of the nodes in the tree are

unique

.

According to the

definition
                of LCA on Wikipedia

: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes

p

and

q

in a binary tree

T

is the lowest node
                that has both

p

and

q

as

descendants

(where we allow

a node to be a descendant of itself

)". A

descendant

of a node

x

is a node

y

that
                is on the path from node

x

to some leaf node.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

Output:

3

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

Output:

5

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition of LCA.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10

Output:

null

Explanation:

Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range

[1, 10

4

]

.

-10

9

<= Node.val <= 10

9

All

Node.val

are

unique

.

p != q

Follow up:

Can you find the LCA traversing the tree, without
            checking nodes existence?

# 1646. Get Maximum in Generated Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1646.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1646.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

You are given an integer

n

. An array

nums

of length

n
            + 1

is generated in the following way:

nums[0] = 0

nums[1] = 1

nums[2 * i] = nums[i]

when

2 <= 2 * i <= n

nums[2 * i + 1] = nums[i] + nums[i + 1]

when

2 <= 2 * i +
                    1 <= n

Return

the

maximum

integer in the array

nums

âââ.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 7

Output:

3

Explanation:

According to the given rules:
  nums[0] = 0
  nums[1] = 1
  nums[(1 * 2) = 2] = nums[1] = 1
  nums[(1 * 2) + 1 = 3] = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 1 = 2
  nums[(2 * 2) = 4] = nums[2] = 1
  nums[(2 * 2) + 1 = 5] = nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 + 2 = 3
  nums[(3 * 2) = 6] = nums[3] = 2
  nums[(3 * 2) + 1 = 7] = nums[3] + nums[4] = 2 + 1 = 3
Hence, nums = [0,1,1,2,1,3,2,3], and the maximum is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 2

Output:

1

Explanation:

According to the given rules, the maximum between nums[0], nums[1], and nums[2] is 1.

Example 3:

Input:

n = 3

Output:

2

Explanation:

According to the given rules, the maximum between nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], and nums[3] is 2.

## 1647-minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique.md

# 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1647.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1647.html)

**Companies:** American Express, Microsoft

## Description

A string

s

is called

good

if there are no two
            different characters in

s

that have the same

frequency

.

Given a string

s

, return

the

minimum

number of
                characters you need to delete to make

s

good

.

The

frequency

of a character in a string is the number of times it
                appears in the string. For example, in the string

"aab"

, the

frequency

of

'a'

is

2

, while the

frequency

of

'b'

is

1

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aab"

Output:

0

Explanation:

s

is already good.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aaabbbcc"

Output:

2

Explanation:

You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".

Example 3:

Input:

s = "ceabaacb"

Output:

2

Explanation:

You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10

5

s

contains only lowercase English letters.

# 1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1648.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1648.html)

**Companies:** Groupon

## Description

You have an

inventory

of different colored balls, and there is a
            customer that wants

orders

balls of

any

color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the
                number of balls

of that color

you currently have in your

inventory

. For example, if you own

6

yellow balls, the
                customer would pay

6

for the first yellow ball. After the transaction,
                there are only

5

yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then
                valued at

5

(i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to
                the customer).

You are given an integer array,

inventory

, where

inventory[i]

represents the number of balls of the

i

th

color that you initially own. You are also given an integer

orders

,
                which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the
                balls

in any order

.

Return

the

maximum

total value that you can attain after selling

orders

colored balls

. As the answer may be too large, return
                it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

inventory = [2,5], orders = 4

Output:

14

Explanation:

Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.

Example 2:

Input:

inventory = [3,5], orders = 6

Output:

19

Explanation:

Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).
The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.

Example 3:

Input:

inventory = [2,8,4,10,6], orders = 20

Output:

110

Example 4:

Input:

inventory = [1000000000], orders = 1000000000

Output:

21

Explanation:

Sell the 1st color 1000000000 times for a total value of 500000000500000000. 500000000500000000 modulo 10

9

+ 7 = 21.

Constraints:

1 <= inventory.length <= 10

5

1 <= inventory[i] <= 10

# 1649. Create Sorted Array through Instructions

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1649.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1649.html)

**Companies:** Akuna Capital

## Description

Given an integer array

instructions

, you are asked to create a sorted
            array from the elements in

instructions

. You start with an empty container

nums

. For each element from

left to right

in

instructions

,
            insert it into

nums

. The

cost

of each insertion is the

minimum

of the following:

The number of elements currently in

nums

that are

strictly
                    less than

instructions[i]

.

The number of elements currently in

nums

that are

strictly
                    greater than

instructions[i]

.

For example, if inserting element

3

into

nums = [1,2,3,5]

,
                the

cost

of insertion is

min(2, 1)

(elements

1

and

2

are less than

3

, element

5

is greater than

3

) and

nums

will become

[1,2,3,3,5]

.

Return

the

total cost

to insert all elements from

instructions

into

nums

. Since the answer may be large, return it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

Example 1:

Input:

instructions = [1,5,6,2]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Begin with nums = [].
Insert 1 with cost min(0, 0) = 0, now nums = [1].
Insert 5 with cost min(1, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,5].
Insert 6 with cost min(2, 0) = 0, now nums = [1,5,6].
Insert 2 with cost min(1, 2) = 1, now nums = [1,2,5,6].
The total cost is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

Example 2:

Input:

instructions = [1,2,3,6,5,4]

Output:

## 1650-lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii.md

# 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1650.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1650.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft

## Description

Given two nodes of a binary tree

p

and

q

, return

their lowest
            common ancestor (LCA)

.

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for

Node

is below:

class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}

According to the

definition
                of LCA on Wikipedia

: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q
                in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow

a node to be a descendant of itself

)."

Example 1:

Input:

root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

Output:

3

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

Output:

5

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:

Input:

root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2

Output:

1

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range

[2, 10

5

]

.

-10

9

<= Node.val <= 10

Drivers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| driver_id   | int     |
| join_date   | date    |
+-------------+---------+
driver_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the driver's ID and the date they joined the Hopper company.

Table:

Rides

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| ride_id      | int     |
| user_id      | int     |
| requested_at | date    |
+--------------+---------+
ride_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a ride, the user's ID that requested it, and the day they requested it.
There may be some ride requests in this table that were not accepted.

Table:

AcceptedRides

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| ride_id       | int     |
| driver_id     | int     |
| ride_distance | int     |
| ride_duration | int     |
+---------------+---------+
ride_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains some information about an accepted ride.
It is guaranteed that each accepted ride exists in the Rides table.

Write an SQL query to compute the

average_ride_distance

and

average_ride_duration

of every 3-month window starting from

January - March 2020

to

October - December 2020

. Round

average_ride_distance

and

average_ride_duration

to the nearest

two decimal
                    places

.

The

average_ride_distance

is calculated by summing up the total

ride_distance

values from the three months and dividing it by

3

. The

average_ride_duration

is calculated in a similar way.

Return the result table ordered by

month

in ascending order, where

month

is the starting month's number (January is

# 1652. Defuse the Bomb

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1652.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1652.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide
            you with a

circular

array

code

of length of

n

and a key

k

.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced

simultaneously

.

If

k > 0

, replace the

i

th

number with
                    the sum of the

next

k

numbers.

If

k < 0

, replace the

i

th

number with
                    the sum of the

previous

k

numbers.

If

k == 0

, replace the

i

th

number with

0

.

As

code

is circular, the next element of

code[n-1]

is

code[0]

, and the previous element of

code[0]

is

code[n-1]

.

Given the

circular

array

code

and an integer key

k

,
                return

the decrypted code to defuse the bomb

!

Example 1:

Input:

code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3

Output:

[12,10,16,13]

Explanation:

Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.

Example 2:

Input:

code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0

Output:

[0,0,0,0]

Explanation:

When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0.

Example 3:

Input:

code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2

Output:

[12,5,6,13]

Explanation:

The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of the

previous

numbers.

Constraints:

n == code.length

1 <= n <= 100

1 <= code[i] <= 100

-(n - 1) <= k <= n - 1

## 1654-minimum-jumps-to-reach-home.md

# 1654. Minimum Jumps to Reach Home

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1654.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1654.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

A certain bug's home is on the x-axis at position

x

. Help them get
            there from position

0

.

The bug jumps according to the following rules:

It can jump exactly

a

positions

forward

(to the
                    right).

It can jump exactly

b

positions

backward

(to the
                    left).

It cannot jump backward twice in a row.

It cannot jump to any

forbidden

positions.

The bug may jump forward

beyond

its home, but it

cannot
                jump

to positions numbered with

negative

integers.

Given an array of integers

forbidden

, where

forbidden[i]

means that the bug cannot jump to the position

forbidden[i]

, and
                integers

a

,

b

, and

x

, return

the minimum
                    number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home

. If there is no
                possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position

x

, return

-1.

Example 1:

Input:

forbidden = [14,4,18,1,15], a = 3, b = 15, x = 9

Output:

3

Explanation:

3 jumps forward (0 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9) will get the bug home.

Example 2:

Input:

forbidden = [8,3,16,6,12,20], a = 15, b = 13, x = 11

Output:

-1

Example 3:

Input:

forbidden = [1,6,2,14,5,17,4], a = 16, b = 9, x = 7

Output:

2

Explanation:

One jump forward (0 -> 16) then one jump backward (16 -> 7) will get the bug home.

Constraints:

1 <= forbidden.length <= 1000

1 <= a, b, forbidden[i] <= 2000

0 <= x <= 2000

All the elements in

forbidden

are distinct.

## 1656-design-an-ordered-stream.md

# 1656. Design an Ordered Stream

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1656.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1656.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg

## Description

There are

n

(id, value)

pairs, where

id

is an
            integer between

1

and

n

and

value

is a string. No
            two pairs have the same

id

.

Design a stream that takes the

n

pairs in an

arbitrary

order, and returns the values over several calls in

increasing order of
                    their ids

.

Implement the

OrderedStream

class:

OrderedStream(int n)

Constructs the stream to take

n

values and sets a current

ptr

to

1

.

String[] insert(int id, String value)

Stores the new

(id,
                    value)

pair in the stream. After storing the pair:

If the stream has stored a pair with

id = ptr

, then find
                            the

longest contiguous incrementing sequence

of ids
                            starting with

id = ptr

and return a list of the values
                            associated with those ids

in order

. Then, update

ptr

to the last

id + 1

.

Otherwise, return an empty list.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input
["OrderedStream", "insert", "insert", "insert", "insert", "insert"]
[[5], [3, "ccccc"], [1, "aaaaa"], [2, "bbbbb"], [5, "eeeee"], [4, "ddddd"]]
Output
[null, [], ["aaaaa"], ["bbbbb", "ccccc"], [], ["ddddd", "eeeee"]]
Explanation
OrderedStream os= new OrderedStream(5);
os.insert(3, "ccccc"); // Inserts (3, "ccccc"), returns [].
os.insert(1, "aaaaa"); // Inserts (1, "aaaaa"), returns ["aaaaa"].
os.insert(2, "bbbbb"); // Inserts (2, "bbbbb"), returns ["bbbbb", "ccccc"].
os.insert(5, "eeeee"); // Inserts (5, "eeeee"), returns [].
os.insert(4, "ddddd"); // Inserts (4, "ddddd"), returns ["ddddd", "eeeee"].
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= id <= n
value.length == 5
value
consists only of lowercase letters.
Each call to
insert
will have a unique
id.
Exactly
n
calls will be made to

## 1659-maximize-grid-happiness.md

# 1659. Maximize Grid Happiness

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1659.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1659.html)

**Companies:** Salesforce

## Description

You are given four integers,

m

,

n

,

introvertsCount

, and

extrovertsCount

. You have an

m x
                n

grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There
            are

introvertsCount

introverts and

extrovertsCount

extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of
                them one grid cell. Note that you

do not

have to have all the
                people living in the grid.

The

happiness

of each person is calculated as follows:

Introverts

start

with

120

happiness and

lose

30

happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Extroverts

start

with

40

happiness and

gain

20

happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a
                person's cell.

The

grid happiness

is the

sum

of each person's
                happiness. Return

the

maximum possible grid happiness

.

Example 1:

Input:

m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2

Output:

240

Explanation:

Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

Example 2:

Input:

m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1

Output:

260

Explanation:

Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

Example 3:

Input:

m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0

Output:

240

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 5

0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m * n, 6)

## 1660-correct-a-binary-tree.md

# 1660. Correct a Binary Tree

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1660.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1660.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You have a binary tree with a small defect. There is

exactly one

invalid node where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the

same
                depth

but to the

invalid node's right

.

Given the root of the binary tree with this defect,

root

, return

the
                root of the binary tree after

removing

this invalid node

and
                    every node underneath it

(minus the node it incorrectly points
                to).

Custom testing:

The test input is read as 3 lines:

TreeNode root

int fromNode

(

not available to

correctBinaryTree

)

int toNode

(

not available to

correctBinaryTree

)

After the binary tree rooted at

root

is parsed, the

TreeNode

with value of

fromNode

will have its right child
                pointer pointing to the

TreeNode

with a value of

toNode

.
                Then,

root

is passed to

correctBinaryTree

.

Example 1:

Input:

root = [1,2,3], fromNode = 2, toNode = 3

Output:

[1,null,3]

Explanation:

The node with value 2 is invalid, so remove it.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [8,3,1,7,null,9,4,2,null,null,null,5,6], fromNode = 7, toNode = 4

Output:

[8,3,1,null,null,9,4,null,null,5,6]

Explanation:

The node with value 7 is invalid, so remove it and the node underneath it, node 2.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range

[3, 10

4

]

.

-10

9

<= Node.val <= 10

9

All

Node.val

are

## 1661-average-time-of-process-per-machine.md

# 1661. Average Time of Process per Machine

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1661.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1661.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

Activity

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the

same
                number of processes

. Write an SQL query to find the

average
                time

each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the

'end' timestamp

minus the

'start'
                timestamp

. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every
                process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the

machine_id

along with the

average
                time

as

processing_time

, which should be

rounded to 3
                decimal places

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

Given two string arrays

word1

and

word2

,
            return

true

if the two arrays

represent

the
                same string, and

false

otherwise.

A string is

represented

by an array if the array elements
                concatenated

in order

forms the string.

Example 1:

Input:

word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]

Output:

true

Explanation:

word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.

Example 2:

Input:

word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]

Output:

false

Example 3:

Input:

word1  = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]

Output:

true

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10

## 1663-smallest-string-with-a-given-numeric-value.md

# 1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1663.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1663.html)

**Companies:** Lendingkart

## Description

The

numeric value

of a

lowercase character

is
            defined as its position

(1-indexed)

in the alphabet, so the numeric value
            of

a

is

1

, the numeric value of

b

is

2

, the numeric value of

c

is

3

, and so on.

The

numeric value

of a

string

consisting of
                lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For
                example, the numeric value of the string

"abe"

is equal to

1 + 2
                    + 5 = 8

.

You are given two integers

n

and

k

. Return

the

lexicographically
                smallest string

with

length

equal to

n

and

numeric value

equal to

k

.

Note that a string

x

is lexicographically smaller than string

y

if

x

comes before

y

in dictionary order,
                that is, either

x

is a prefix of

y

, or if

i

is the first position such that

x[i] != y[i]

, then

x[i]

comes before

y[i]

in alphabetic order.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 3, k = 27

Output:

"aay"

Explanation:

The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5, k = 73

Output:

"aaszz"

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10

5

n <= k <= 26 * n

# 1664. Ways to Make a Fair Array

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1664.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1664.html)

**Companies:** dunzo

## Description

You are given an integer array

nums

. You can choose

exactly
            one

index (

0-indexed

) and remove the element. Notice that the
            index of the elements may change after the removal.

For example, if

nums = [6,1,7,4,1]

:

Choosing to remove index

1

results in

nums = [6,7,4,1]

.

Choosing to remove index

2

results in

nums = [6,1,4,1]

.

Choosing to remove index

4

results in

nums = [6,1,7,4]

.

An array is

fair

if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum
                of the even-indexed values.

Return the

number

of indices that you could choose such that
                after the removal,

nums

is

fair

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2,1,6,4]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Remove index 0: [1,6,4] -> Even sum: 1 + 4 = 5. Odd sum: 6. Not fair.
Remove index 1: [2,6,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 6. Fair.
Remove index 2: [2,1,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 1. Not fair.
Remove index 3: [2,1,6] -> Even sum: 2 + 6 = 8. Odd sum: 1. Not fair.
There is 1 index that you can remove to make nums fair.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,1,1]

Output:

3

Explanation:

You can remove any index and the remaining array is fair.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3]

Output:

0

Explanation:

You cannot make a fair array after removing any index.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10

# 1665. Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1665.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1665.html)

**Companies:** Akuna Capital

## Description

You are given an array

tasks

where

tasks[i] = [actual

i

,
            minimum

i

]

:

actual

i

is the actual amount of energy you

spend
                    to finish

the

i

th

task.

minimum

i

is the minimum amount of energy you

require
                    to begin

the

i

th

task.

For example, if the task is

[10, 12]

and your current energy is

11

, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is

13

, you can complete this task, and your energy will be

3

after finishing it.

You can finish the tasks in

any order

you like.

Return

the

minimum

initial amount of energy you will need

to finish all the tasks

.

Example 1:

Input:

tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,8]]

Output:

8

Explanation:

Starting with 8 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
    - 3rd task. Now energy = 8 - 4 = 4.
    - 2nd task. Now energy = 4 - 2 = 2.
    - 1st task. Now energy = 2 - 1 = 1.
Notice that even though we have leftover energy, starting with 7 energy does not work because we cannot do the 3rd task.

Example 2:

Input:

tasks = [[1,3],[2,4],[10,11],[10,12],[8,9]]

Output:

32

Explanation:

Starting with 32 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
    - 1st task. Now energy = 32 - 1 = 31.
    - 2nd task. Now energy = 31 - 2 = 29.
    - 3rd task. Now energy = 29 - 10 = 19.
    - 4th task. Now energy = 19 - 10 = 9.
    - 5th task. Now energy = 9 - 8 = 1.

Example 3:

Input:

tasks = [[1,7],[2,8],[3,9],[4,10],[5,11],[6,12]]

Output:

27

Explanation:

Starting with 27 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
    - 5th task. Now energy = 27 - 5 = 22.
    - 2nd task. Now energy = 22 - 2 = 20.
    - 3rd task. Now energy = 20 - 3 = 17.
    - 1st task. Now energy = 17 - 1 = 16.
    - 4th task. Now energy = 16 - 4 = 12.
    - 6th task. Now energy = 12 - 6 = 6.

# 1670. Design Front Middle Back Queue

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1670.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1670.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

Design a queue that supports

push

and

pop

operations in
            the front, middle, and back.

Implement the

FrontMiddleBack

class:

FrontMiddleBack()

Initializes the queue.

void pushFront(int val)

Adds

val

to the

front

of the queue.

void pushMiddle(int val)

Adds

val

to the

middle

of the queue.

void pushBack(int val)

Adds

val

to the

back

of the queue.

int popFront()

Removes the

front

element of the
                    queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return

-1

.

int popMiddle()

Removes the

middle

element of the
                    queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return

-1

.

int popBack()

Removes the

back

element of the
                    queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return

-1

.

Notice

that when there are

two

middle position choices, the
                operation is performed on the

frontmost

middle position choice. For
                example:

Pushing

6

into the middle of

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

results
                    in

[1, 2,

6

, 3, 4, 5]

.

Popping the middle from

[1, 2,

3

, 4, 5, 6]

returns

3

and results in

[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]

.

Example 1:

Input:

["FrontMiddleBackQueue", "pushFront", "pushBack", "pushMiddle", "pushMiddle", "popFront", "popMiddle", "popMiddle", "popBack", "popFront"]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [], []]

Output:

[null, null, null, null, null, 1, 3, 4, 2, -1]

Explanation:

FrontMiddleBackQueue q = new FrontMiddleBackQueue();
q.pushFront(1);   // [

1

]
q.pushBack(2);    // [1,

2

]
q.pushMiddle(3);  // [1,

3

, 2]
q.pushMiddle(4);  // [1,

4

, 3, 2]
q.popFront();     // return 1 -> [4, 3, 2]
q.popMiddle();    // return 3 -> [4, 2]
q.popMiddle();    // return 4 -> [2]
q.popBack();      // return 2 -> []
q.popFront();     // return -1 -> [] (The queue is empty)

Constraints:

1 <= val <= 10

9

At most

1000

calls will be made
                    to

number of elements to remove to make

nums

âââ

a

mountain array

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,3,1]

Output:

0

Explanation:

The array itself is a mountain array so we do not need to remove any elements.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2,1,1,5,6,2,3,1]

Output:

3

Explanation:

One solution is to remove the elements at indices 0, 1, and 5, making the array nums = [1,5,6,3,1].

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [4,3,2,1,1,2,3,1]

Output:

4

Example 4:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]

Output:

1

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 1000

1 <= nums[i] <= 10

that the richest customer has.

A customer's

wealth

is the amount of money they have in all their
                bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum

wealth

.

Example 1:

Input:

accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]

Output:

6

Explanation

:

1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

Example 2:

Input:

accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]

Output:

10

Explanation

:
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

Example 3:

# 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1673.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1673.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given an integer array

nums

and a positive integer

k

,
            return

the most

competitive

subsequence of

nums

of size

k

.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly
                zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence

a

is more

competitive

than
                a subsequence

b

(of the same length) if in the first position where

a

and

b

differ, subsequence

a

has a number

less

than the corresponding number in

b

. For example,

[1,3,4]

is more competitive than

[1,3,5]

because the first
                position they differ is at the final number, and

4

is less than

5

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2

Output:

[2,6]

Explanation:

Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4

Output:

[2,3,3,4]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10

# 1674. Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1674.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1674.html)

**Companies:** CureFit

## Description

You are given an integer array

nums

of

even

length

n

and an integer

limit

. In one move, you can replace any
            integer from

nums

with another integer between

1

and

limit

,
            inclusive.

The array

nums

is

complementary

if for all indices

i

(

0-indexed

),

nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]

equals the same number. For example, the array

[1,2,3,4]

is
                complementary because for all indices

i

,

nums[i] + nums[n - 1 -
                    i] = 5

.

Return the

minimum

number of moves required to make

nums

complementary

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,4,3], limit = 4

Output:

1

Explanation:

In 1 move, you can change nums to [1,2,

2

,3] (underlined elements are changed).
nums[0] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.
nums[2] + nums[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
nums[3] + nums[0] = 3 + 1 = 4.
Therefore, nums[i] + nums[n-1-i] = 4 for every i, so nums is complementary.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,2,2,1], limit = 2

Output:

2

Explanation:

In 2 moves, you can change nums to [

2

,2,2,

2

]. You cannot change any number to 3 since 3 > limit.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,2,1,2], limit = 2

Output:

0

Explanation:

nums is already complementary.

Constraints:

n == nums.length

2 <= n <= 10

5

1 <= nums[i] <= limit <= 10

5

n

is even.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1675.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1675.html)

**Companies:** Samsung

## Description

You are given an array

nums

of

n

positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of
                times:

If the element is

even

,

divide

it by

2

.

For example, if the array is

[1,2,3,4]

, then you can do
                            this operation on the last element, and the array will be

[1,2,3,

2

].

If the element is

odd

,

multiply

it by

2

.

For example, if the array is

[1,2,3,4]

, then you can do
                            this operation on the first element, and the array will be

[

2

,2,3,4].

The

deviation

of the array is the

maximum
                difference

between any two elements in the array.

Return

the

minimum deviation

the array can have after performing
                some number of operations.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output:

1

Explanation:

You can transform the array to [1,2,3,

2

], then to [

2

,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [4,1,5,20,3]

Output:

3

Explanation:

You can transform the array after two operations to [4,

2

,5,

5

,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.

# 1681. Minimum Incompatibility

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1681.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1681.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

You are given an integer array

nums

âââ and an integer

k

.
            You are asked to distribute this array into

k

subsets of

equal
                size

such that there are no two equal elements in the same subset.

A subset's

incompatibility

is the difference between the maximum and
                minimum elements in that array.

Return

the

minimum possible sum of incompatibilities

of the

k

subsets after distributing the array optimally, or
                return

-1

if it is not possible.

A subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,1,4], k = 2

Output:

4

Explanation:

The optimal distribution of subsets is [1,2] and [1,4].
The incompatibility is (2-1) + (4-1) = 4.
Note that [1,1] and [2,4] would result in a smaller sum, but the first subset contains 2 equal elements.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [6,3,8,1,3,1,2,2], k = 4

Output:

6

Explanation:

The optimal distribution of subsets is [1,2], [2,3], [6,8], and [1,3].
The incompatibility is (2-1) + (3-2) + (8-6) + (3-1) = 6.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [5,3,3,6,3,3], k = 3

Output:

-1

Explanation:

It is impossible to distribute nums into 3 subsets where no two elements are equal in the same subset.

# 1686. Stone Game VI

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1686.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1686.html)

**Companies:** APT Portfolio

## Description

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are

n

stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can

remove

a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob
                may

value the stones differently

.

You are given two integer arrays of length

n

,

aliceValues

and

bobValues

. Each

aliceValues[i]

and

bobValues[i]

represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the

i

th

stone.

The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If
                both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both
                players will play

optimally

.

Determine the result of the game, and:

If Alice wins, return

1

.

If Bob wins, return

-1

.

If the game results in a draw, return

0

.

Example 1:

Input:

aliceValues = [1,3], bobValues = [2,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

If Alice takes stone 1 (0-indexed) first, Alice will receive 3 points.
Bob can only choose stone 0, and will only receive 2 points.
Alice wins.

Example 2:

Input:

aliceValues = [1,2], bobValues = [3,1]

Output:

0

Explanation:

If Alice takes stone 0, and Bob takes stone 1, they will both have 1 point.
Draw.

Example 3:

Input:

aliceValues = [2,4,3], bobValues = [1,6,7]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

Regardless of how Alice plays, Bob will be able to have more points than Alice.
For example, if Alice takes stone 1, Bob can take stone 2, and Alice takes stone 0, Alice will have 6 points to Bob's 7.
Bob wins.

## 1687-delivering-boxes-from-storage-to-ports.md

# 1687. Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1687.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1687.html)

**Companies:** Nutanix

## Description

You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only
            one ship. However, this ship has a

limit

on the

number of
                boxes

and the

total weight

that it can carry.

You are given an array

boxes

, where

boxes[i] =
                [ports

ââi

â, weight

i

]

, and three integers

portsCount

,

maxBoxes

, and

maxWeight

.

ports

ââi

is the port where you need to deliver the

i

th

box and

weights

i

is the
                    weight of the

i

th

box.

portsCount

is the number of ports.

maxBoxes

and

maxWeight

are the respective box and
                    weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered

in the order they are given

. The ship
                will follow these steps:

The ship will take some number of boxes from the

boxes

queue, not
                    violating the

maxBoxes

and

maxWeight

constraints.

For each loaded box

in order

, the ship will make a

trip

to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver
                    it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no

trip

is
                    needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.

The ship then makes a return

trip

to storage to take more boxes
                    from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.

Return

the

minimum

number of

trips

the ship
                needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.

Example 1:

Input:

boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3

Output:

4

Explanation:

The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.
So the total number of trips is 4.
Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).

Example 2:

Input:

boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6

Output:

6

Explanation:

The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Example 3:

Input:

boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7

Output:

6

Explanation:

The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Example 4:

Input:

boxes = [[2,4],[2,5],[3,1],[3,2],[3,7],[3,1],[4,4],[1,3],[5,2]], portsCount = 5, maxBoxes = 5, maxWeight = 7

Output:

14

Explanation:

The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the sixth and seventh boxes, goes to port 3, then port 4, then storage. 3 trips.
- The ship takes the eighth and ninth boxes, goes to port 1, then port 5, then storage. 3 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.

Constraints:

1 <= boxes.length <= 10

1 <= portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight <= 10

## 1690-stone-game-vii.md

# 1690. Stone Game VII

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1690.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1690.html)

**Companies:** Dunzo

## Description

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with

Alice starting first

.

There are

n

stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can

remove

either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the
                row and receive points equal to the

sum

of the remaining stones'
                values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no
                stones left to remove.

Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he
                decided to

minimize the score's difference

. Alice's goal is to

maximize the difference

in the score.

Given an array of integers

stones

where

stones[i]

represents the value of the

i

th

stone

from the
                    left

, return

the

difference

in Alice and Bob's
                    score if they both play

optimally

.

Example 1:

Input:

stones = [5,3,1,4,2]

Output:

6

Explanation:

- Alice removes 2 and gets 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 0, stones = [5,3,1,4].
- Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = [3,1,4].
- Alice removes 3 and gets 1 + 4 = 5 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 8, stones = [1,4].
- Bob removes 1 and gets 4 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [4].
- Alice removes 4 and gets 0 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [].
The score difference is 18 - 12 = 6.

## Description

Given

n

cuboids

where the dimensions of the

th

cuboid is

cuboids[i] = [width

i

, length

i

,
                height

]

(

0-indexed

). Choose a

subset

of

cuboids

and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid

i

on cuboid

j

if

width

i

<= width

j

and

length

i

<= length

j

and

height

i

<=
                    height

j

. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating
                it to put it on another cuboid.

Return

the

maximum height

of the stacked

cuboids

.

Example 1:

Input:

cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]

Output:

190

Explanation:

Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.
Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.
Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.
The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.

Example 2:

Input:

cuboids = [[38,25,45],[76,35,3]]

Output:

76

Explanation:

You can't place any of the cuboids on the other.
We choose cuboid 1 and rotate it so that the 35x3 side is facing down and its height is 76.

Example 3:

Input:

cuboids = [[7,11,17],[7,17,11],[11,7,17],[11,17,7],[17,7,11],[17,11,7]]

Output:

102

Explanation:

After rearranging the cuboids, you can see that all cuboids have the same dimension.
You can place the 11x7 side down on all cuboids so their heights are 17.
The maximum height of stacked cuboids is 6 * 17 = 102.

if the candies in one bag in the first way are not all in
                the same bag in the second way. The order of the bags and the order of the candies
                within each bag do not matter.

For example,

(1), (2,3)

and

(2), (1,3)

are considered
                different because candies

2

and

3

in the bag

# 1694. Reformat Phone Number

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1694.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1694.html)

**Companies:** Activision

## Description

You are given a phone number as a string

number

.

number

consists of digits, spaces

' '

, and/or dashes

'-'

.

You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly,

remove

all spaces and dashes. Then,

group

the digits from left to right
                into blocks of length 3

until

there are 4 or fewer digits. The
                final digits are then grouped as follows:

2 digits: A single block of length 2.

3 digits: A single block of length 3.

4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.

The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should

never

produce any blocks of length 1 and produce

at
                    most

two blocks of length 2.

Return

the phone number after formatting.

Example 1:

Input:

number = "1-23-45 6"

Output:

"123-456"

Explanation:

The digits are "123456".
Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".
Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is "456".
Joining the blocks gives "123-456".

Example 2:

Input:

number = "123 4-567"

Output:

"123-45-67"

Explanation:

The digits are "1234567".
Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".
Step 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are "45" and "67".
Joining the blocks gives "123-45-67".

Example 3:

Input:

number = "123 4-5678"

Output:

"123-456-78"

Explanation:

The digits are "12345678".
Step 1: The 1st block is "123".
Step 2: The 2nd block is "456".
Step 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is "78".
Joining the blocks gives "123-456-78".

Example 4:

Input:

number = "12"

Output:

"12"

Example 5:

Input:

number = "--17-5 229 35-39475 "

Output:

"175-229-353-94-75"

Constraints:

2 <= number.length <= 100

number

consists of digits and the characters

'-'

and

' '

.

There are at least

two

digits in

number

.

with
            distance

dis

i

. Note that there may be

multiple

edges between two nodes.

Given an array

queries

, where

queries[j] = [p

j

,
                q

Explanation:

The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1,10],[1,2,5],[2,3,9],[3,4,13]], queries = [[0,4,14],[1,4,13]]

# 1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1700.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1700.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred
            to by numbers

0

and

1

respectively. All students stand in a
            queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The
                sandwiches are placed in a

stack

. At each step:

If the student at the front of the queue

prefers

the sandwich
                    on the top of the stack, they will

take it

and leave the queue.

Otherwise, they will

leave it

and go to the queue's end.

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are
                thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays

students

and

sandwiches

where

sandwiches[i]

is the type of the

i

ââââââth

sandwich in the stack (

i = 0

is the
                top of the stack) and

students[j]

is the preference of the

j

ââââââth

student in the initial queue (

j = 0

is the front of the queue). Return

the number of students that are unable to eat.

Example 1:

Input:

students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]

Output:

0

Explanation:

- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1] and sandwiches = [1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [] and sandwiches = [].
Hence all students are able to eat.

Example 2:

Input:

students = [1,1,1,0,0,1], sandwiches = [1,0,0,0,1,1]

Output:

3

Constraints:

1 <= students.length, sandwiches.length <= 100

Explanation:

1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 2, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 3, and finishes at time 8, so the waiting time of the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 4, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 8, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the third customer is 11 - 4 = 7.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.

Example 2:

Input:

customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]

Output:

3.25000

Explanation:

1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 7, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 11, and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.
4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25.

th

day, the tree grows

apples[i]

apples that will rot after

days[i]

days, that is on day

i +
                days[i]

the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the
            apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by

apples[i] == 0

and

days[i] == 0

.

You decided to eat

at most

one apple a day (to keep the doctors
                away). Note that you can keep eating after the first

n

days.

Given two integer arrays

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You have a 2-D

grid

of size

m x n

representing a box, and
            you have

n

balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can
                redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the
                    bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as

1

.

A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the
                    bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as

-1

.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the
                box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern
                between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return

an array

answer

of size

n

where

answer[i]

is the column that the ball falls out of at
                the bottom after dropping the ball from the

i

th

column at the top, or

-1

if the ball gets stuck in the
                box

.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]

Output:

[1,-1,-1,-1,-1]

Explanation:

This example is shown in the photo.
Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.
Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.

Example 2:

Input:

grid = [[-1]]

Output:

[-1]

Explanation:

The ball gets stuck against the left wall.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1712.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1712.html)

**Companies:** Robinhood

## Description

A split of an integer array is

good

if:

The array is split into three

non-empty

contiguous subarrays -
                    named

left

,

mid

,

right

respectively from
                    left to right.

The sum of the elements in

left

is less than or equal to the sum of
                    the elements in

mid

, and the sum of the elements in

mid

is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in

right

.

Given

nums

, an array of

non-negative

integers, return

the number of

good

ways to split

nums

. As the
                number may be too large, return it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,1,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

The only good way to split nums is [1] [1] [1].

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,2,2,2,5,0]

Output:

3

Explanation:

There are three good ways of splitting nums:
[1] [2] [2,2,5,0]
[1] [2,2] [2,5,0]
[1,2] [2,2] [5,0]

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [3,2,1]

Output:

## 1713-minimum-operations-to-make-a-subsequence.md

# 1713. Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1713.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1713.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given an array

target

that consists of

distinct

integers and another integer array

arr

that

can

have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in

arr

. For
                example, if

arr = [1,4,1,2]

, you can add

3

in the middle
                and make it

[1,4,

3

,1,2]

. Note that you can insert the integer at
                the very beginning or end of the array.

Return

the

minimum

number of operations needed to make

target

a

subsequence

of

arr

.

A

subsequence

of an array is a new array generated from the original
                array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining
                elements' relative order. For example,

[2,7,4]

is a subsequence of

[4,

2

,3,

7

,2,1,

4

]

(the underlined elements), while

[2,4,2]

is not.

Example 1:

Input:

target = [5,1,3],

arr

= [9,4,2,3,4]

Output:

2

Explanation:

You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes

arr

= [

5

,9,4,

1

,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of

arr

.

Example 2:

Input:

target = [6,4,8,1,3,2],

arr

= [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]

Output:

3

Constraints:

1 <= target.length, arr.length <= 10

5

1 <= target[i], arr[i] <= 10

9

target

contains no duplicates.

# 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1718.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1718.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

Given an integer

n

, find a sequence that satisfies all of the
            following:

The integer

1

occurs once in the sequence.

Each integer between

2

and

n

occurs twice in the
                    sequence.

For every integer

i

between

2

and

n

, the

distance

between the two occurrences of

i

is
                    exactly

i

.

The

distance

between two numbers on the sequence,

a[i]

and

a[j]

, is the absolute difference of their indices,

|j -
                    i|

.

Return

the

lexicographically largest

sequence

. It is
                guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence

a

is lexicographically larger than a sequence

b

(of the same length) if in the first position where

a

and

b

differ, sequence

a

has a number greater than the
                corresponding number in

b

. For example,

[0,1,9,0]

is
                lexicographically larger than

[0,1,5,6]

because the first position they
                differ is at the third number, and

9

is greater than

5

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 3

Output:

[3,1,2,3,2]

Explanation:

[2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5

# 1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1722.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1722.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given two integer arrays,

source

and

target

, both
            of length

n

. You are also given an array

allowedSwaps

where
            each

allowedSwaps[i] = [a

i

, b

i

]

indicates that you
            are allowed to swap the elements at index

a

i

and index

b

i

(0-indexed)

of array

source

.
            Note that you can swap elements at a specific pair of indices

multiple

times and in

any

order.

The

Hamming distance

of two arrays of the same length,

source

and

target

, is the number of positions where the
                elements are different. Formally, it is the number of indices

i

for

0 <= i <= n-1

where

source[i] != target[i]

(0-indexed)

.

Return

the

minimum Hamming distance

of

source

and

target

after performing

any

amount of swap operations on array

source

.

Example 1:

Input:

source = [1,2,3,4], target = [2,1,4,5], allowedSwaps = [[0,1],[2,3]]

Output:

1

Explanation:

source can be transformed the following way:
- Swap indices 0 and 1: source = [

2

,

1

,3,4]
- Swap indices 2 and 3: source = [2,1,

4

,

3

]
The Hamming distance of source and target is 1 as they differ in 1 position: index 3.

Example 2:

Input:

source = [1,2,3,4], target = [1,3,2,4], allowedSwaps = []

Output:

2

Explanation:

There are no allowed swaps.
The Hamming distance of source and target is 2 as they differ in 2 positions: index 1 and index 2.

Example 3:

Input:

source = [5,1,2,4,3], target = [1,5,4,2,3], allowedSwaps = [[0,4],[4,2],[1,3],[1,4]]

Output:

0

Constraints:

n == source.length == target.length

1 <= n <= 10

5

1 <= source[i], target[i] <= 10

5

0 <= allowedSwaps.length <= 10

is the
            amount of time it takes to complete the

i

th

job.

There are

k

workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be
                assigned to

exactly

one worker. The

working time

of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them.
                Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the

maximum working
                    time

of any worker is

minimized

.

Return the

# 1728. Cat and Mouse II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1728.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1728.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a

grid

of size

rows x
                cols

, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

Players are represented by the characters

'C'

(Cat)

,'M'

(Mouse).

Floors are represented by the character

'.'

and can be walked on.

Walls are represented by the character

'#'

and cannot be walked on.

Food is represented by the character

'F'

and can be walked on.

There is only one of each character

'C'

,

'M'

, and

'F'

in

grid

.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

Mouse

moves first

, then they take turns to move.

During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left,
                    right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the

grid

.

catJump, mouseJump

are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump
                    at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.

Staying in the same position is allowed.

Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.

If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.

If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.

If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a

rows x cols

matrix

grid

and two integers

catJump

and

mouseJump

, return

true

if Mouse can win the game
                    if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = ["####F","#C...","M...."], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2

Output:

true

Explanation:

Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.

Example 2:

This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).

For this problem, we will consider a

manager

an employee who has at
                least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all

managers

,
                the number of employees who report

directly

to them, and the
                average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by

employee_id

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+

Result table:
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1737.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1737.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given two strings

a

and

b

that consist of
            lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in

a

or

b

to

any lowercase letter

.

Your goal is to satisfy

one

of the following three conditions:

Every

letter in

a

is

strictly
                    less

than

every

letter in

b

in the
                    alphabet.

Every

letter in

b

is

strictly
                    less

than

every

letter in

a

in the
                    alphabet.

Both

a

and

b

consist of

only
                    one

distinct letter.

Return

the

minimum

number of operations needed to achieve your
                goal.

Example 1:

Input:

a = "aba", b = "caa"

Output:

2

Explanation:

Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).

Example 2:

Input:

a = "dabadd", b = "cda"

Output:

3

Explanation:

The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".

## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

Employees

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| emp_id      | int  |
| event_day   | date |
| in_time     | int  |
| out_time    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key of this table.
The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
event_day is the day at which this event happened and in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office and out_time is the time at which he got outnumbered from 1 to 1440.
It's guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time.

Write an SQL query to calculate the total time

in minutes

spent by
                each employee on each day at the office. Note that within one day, an employee can
                enter and leave more than once.

Return the result table in

any order

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employees table:
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
Result table:
+------------+--------+------------+
| day        | emp_id | total_time |
+------------+--------+------------+
| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |

| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |
+------------+--------+------------+
Employee 1 has three events two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (32 - 4) + (200-55) = 173 and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total of (42 - 1) = 41.
Employee 2 has two events one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (33-3) = 30 and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.

# 1743. Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1743.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1743.html)

**Companies:** Robinhood

## Description

There is an integer array

nums

that consists of

n

unique

elements,
            but you have forgotten it. However, you do remember every pair of adjacent elements in

nums

.

You are given a 2D integer array

adjacentPairs

of size

n -
                1

where each

adjacentPairs[i] = [u

i

, v

i

]

indicates that the elements

u

i

and

v

i

are adjacent in

nums

.

It is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements

nums[i]

and

nums[i+1]

will exist in

adjacentPairs

, either as

[nums[i],
                    nums[i+1]]

or

[nums[i+1], nums[i]]

. The pairs can appear

in any order

.

Return

the original array

nums

. If there are multiple
                solutions, return

any of them

.

Example 1:

Input:

adjacentPairs = [[2,1],[3,4],[3,2]]

Output:

[1,2,3,4]

Explanation:

This array has all its adjacent pairs in adjacentPairs.
Notice that adjacentPairs[i] may not be in left-to-right order.

Example 2:

Input:

adjacentPairs = [[4,-2],[1,4],[-3,1]]

Output:

[-2,4,1,-3]

Explanation:

There can be negative numbers.
Another solution is [-3,1,4,-2], which would also be accepted.

Example 3:

Input:

adjacentPairs = [[100000,-100000]]

Output:

[100000,-100000]

Constraints:

nums.length == n

adjacentPairs.length == n - 1

adjacentPairs[i].length == 2

# 1744. Can You Eat Your Favorite Candy on Your Favorite Day?

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1744.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1744.html)

**Companies:** Fleetx

## Description

You are given a

(0-indexed)

array of positive integers

candiesCount

where

candiesCount[i]

represents the number of candies of
            the

i

th

type you have. You are also given a 2D array

queries

where

queries[i] = [favoriteType

i

,
                favoriteDay

i

, dailyCap

i

]

.

You play a game with the following rules:

You start eating candies on day

0

.

You

cannot

eat

any

candy of type

i

unless
                    you have eaten

all

candies of type

i - 1

.

You must eat

at least

one

candy per day until
                    you have eaten all the candies.

Construct a boolean array

answer

such that

answer.length ==
                queries.length

and

answer[i]

is

true

if you can eat
                a candy of type

favoriteType

i

on day

favoriteDay

i

without eating

more than

dailyCap

i

candies on

any

day, and

false

otherwise. Note that you can eat different types of candy on the same day, provided
                that you follow rule 2.

Return

the constructed array

answer

.

Example 1:

Input:

candiesCount = [7,4,5,3,8], queries = [[0,2,2],[4,2,4],[2,13,1000000000]]

Output:

[true,false,true]

Explanation:

1- If you eat 2 candies (type 0) on day 0 and 2 candies (type 0) on day 1, you will eat a candy of type 0 on day 2.
2- You can eat at most 4 candies each day.
   If you eat 4 candies every day, you will eat 4 candies (type 0) on day 0 and 4 candies (type 0 and type 1) on day 1.
   On day 2, you can only eat 4 candies (type 1 and type 2), so you cannot eat a candy of type 4 on day 2.
3- If you eat 1 candy each day, you will eat a candy of type 2 on day 13.

Example 2:

Input:

candiesCount = [5,2,6,4,1], queries = [[3,1,2],[4,10,3],[3,10,100],[4,100,30],[1,3,1]]

Output:

[false,true,true,false,false]

true

if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated

some

number of positions (including zero)

. Otherwise, return

false

.

There may be

duplicates

in the original array.

Note:

An array

A

rotated by

x

positions results in an array

B

of the same length such that

# 1753. Maximum Score From Removing Stones

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1753.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1753.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are playing a solitaire game with

three piles

of stones of sizes

a

ââââââ,

b

,ââââââ and

c

ââââââ respectively. Each turn you choose two

different non-empty

piles, take one stone from each, and add

1

point to your score. The game stops when there are

fewer than two non-empty

piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers

a

âââââ,

b

,âââââ and

c

âââââ, return

the

maximum

score

you can get.

Example 1:

Input:

a = 2, b = 4, c = 6

Output:

6

Explanation:

The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.

Example 2:

Input:

a = 4, b = 4, c = 6

Output:

7

Explanation:

The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.

Example 3:

Input:

a = 1, b = 8, c = 8

Output:

8

Explanation:

One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.
After that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.

Constraints:

1 <= a, b, c <= 10

## 1754-largest-merge-of-two-strings.md

# 1754. Largest Merge Of Two Strings

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1754.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1754.html)

**Companies:** Snapchat

## Description

You are given two strings

word1

and

word2

. You want to construct a string

merge

in the following way: while either

word1

or

word2

are non-empty, choose

one

of the following options:

If

word1

is non-empty, append the

first

character in

word1

to

merge

and delete it from

word1

.

For example, if

word1 = "abc"

and

merge = "dv"

, then after choosing this operation,

word1 = "bc"

and

merge = "dva"

.

If

word2

is non-empty, append the

first

character in

word2

to

merge

and delete it from

word2

.

For example, if

word2 = "abc"

and

merge = ""

, then after choosing this operation,

word2 = "bc"

and

merge = "a"

.

Return

the lexicographically

largest

merge

you can construct

.

A string

a

is lexicographically larger than a string

b

(of the same length) if in the first position where

a

and

b

differ,

a

has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in

b

. For example,

"abcd"

is lexicographically larger than

"abcc"

because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and

d

is greater than

c

.

Example 1:

Input:

word1 = "cabaa", word2 = "bcaaa"

Output:

"cbcabaaaaa"

Explanation:

One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = "c", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cb", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "caaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cbc", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbca", word1 = "baa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbcab", word1 = "aa", word2 = "aaa"
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.

Example 2:

Input:

word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abdcaba"

Output:

"abdcabcabcaba"

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000

word1

and

word2

consist only of lowercase English letters.

## 1755-closest-subsequence-sum.md

# 1755. Closest Subsequence Sum

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1755.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1755.html)

**Companies:** Sprinklr

## Description

You are given an integer array

nums

and an integer

goal

.

You want to choose a subsequence of

nums

such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to

goal

. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is

sum

, then you want to

minimize the absolute difference

abs(sum - goal)

.

Return

the

minimum

possible value of

abs(sum - goal)

.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements

(possibly all or none)

of the original array.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6

Output:

0

Explanation:

Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5

Output:

1

Explanation:

Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7

Output:

7

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 40

Implement the

MRUQueue

class:

MRUQueue(int n)

constructs the

MRUQueue

with

n

elements:

[1,2,3,...,n]

.

fetch(int k)

moves the

k

th

element

(1-indexed)

to the end of the queue and returns it.

Example 1:

Input:

["MRUQueue", "fetch", "fetch", "fetch", "fetch"]
[[8], [3], [5], [2], [8]]

Output:

[null, 3, 6, 2, 2]

Explanation:

MRUQueue mRUQueue = new MRUQueue(8); // Initializes the queue to [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].
mRUQueue.fetch(3); // Moves the 3

rd

element (3) to the end of the queue to become [1,2,4,5,6,7,8,3] and returns it.
mRUQueue.fetch(5); // Moves the 5

th

element (6) to the end of the queue to become [1,2,4,5,7,8,3,6] and returns it.
mRUQueue.fetch(2); // Moves the 2

nd

element (2) to the end of the queue to become [1,4,5,7,8,3,6,2] and returns it.
mRUQueue.fetch(8); // The 8

th

element (2) is already at the end of the queue so just return it.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2000

1 <= k <= n

At most

2000

calls will be made to

fetch

.

Follow up:

Finding an

O(n)

.

You can perform the following operation at most

maxOperations

times:

Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a

positive

number of balls.

For example, a bag of

5

balls can become two new bags of

1

and

4

balls, or two new bags of

2

and

3

balls.

Your penalty is the

maximum

number of balls in a bag. You want to

minimize

your penalty after the operations.

Return

the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [9], maxOperations = 2

Output:

3

Explanation:

- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [

9

] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [

6

,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4

Output:

2

Explanation:

- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,

,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,

4

,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [7,17], maxOperations = 2

## 1763-longest-nice-substring.md

# 1763. Longest Nice Substring

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1763.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1763.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

A string

s

is

nice

if, for every letter of the alphabet that

s

contains, it appears

both

in uppercase and lowercase. For example,

"abABB"

is nice because

'A'

and

'a'

appear, and

'B'

and

'b'

appear. However,

"abA"

is not because

'b'

appears, but

'B'

does not.

Given a string

s

, return

the longest

substring

of

s

that is

nice

. If there are multiple, return the substring of the

earliest

occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "YazaAay"

Output:

"aAa"

Explanation:

"aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.
"aAa" is the longest nice substring.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "Bb"

Output:

"Bb"

Explanation:

"Bb" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "c"

Output:

""

Explanation:

There are no nice substrings.

Example 4:

Input:

s = "dDzeE"

Output:

"dD"

Explanation:

Both "dD" and "eE" are the longest nice substrings.
As there are multiple longest nice substrings, return "dD" since it occurs earlier.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100

s

consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

subarray as [1,-1,0,

1,-1,-1

,3,-2,0] and the 1

st

one as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,

3,-2,0

].
These subarrays are disjoint as they share no common nums[k] element.

Example 2:

Input:

groups = [[10,-2],[1,2,3,4]], nums = [1,2,3,4,10,-2]

Output:

false

Explanation:

Note that choosing the subarrays [

1,2,3,4

,10,-2] and [1,2,3,4,

10,-2

] is incorrect because they are not in the same order as in groups.
[10,-2] must come before [1,2,3,4].

Example 3:

Input:

groups = [[1,2,3],[3,4]], nums = [7,7,1,2,3,4,7,7]

Output:

false

Explanation:

Note that choosing the subarrays [7,7,

1,2,3

,4,7,7] and [7,7,1,2,

3,4

,7,7] is invalid because they are not disjoint.
They share a common elements nums[4] (0-indexed).

Constraints:

groups.length == n

1 <= n <= 10

# 1765. Map of Highest Peak

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1765.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1765.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given an integer matrix

isWater

of size

m x n

that represents a map of

land

and

water

cells.

If

isWater[i][j] == 0

, cell

(i, j)

is a

land

cell.

If

isWater[i][j] == 1

, cell

(i, j)

is a

water

cell.

You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:

The height of each cell must be non-negative.

If the cell is a

water

cell, its height must be

0

.

Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of

at most

1

. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is

maximized

.

Return

an integer matrix

height

of size

m x n

where

height[i][j]

is cell

(i, j)

's height. If there are multiple solutions, return

any

of them

.

Example 1:

Input:

isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]

Output:

[[1,0],[2,1]]

Explanation:

The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.
The blue cell is the water cell, and the green cells are the land cells.

Example 2:

Input:

isWater = [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]

Output:

[[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,2,2]]

Explanation:

A height of 2 is the maximum possible height of any assignment.
Any height assignment that has a maximum height of 2 while still meeting the rules will also be accepted.

Constraints:

m == isWater.length

n == isWater[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 1000

isWater[i][j]

is

0

or

1

.

There is at least

one

water cell.

## 1766-tree-of-coprimes.md

# 1766. Tree of Coprimes

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1766.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1766.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of

n

nodes numbered from

0

to

n - 1

and exactly

n - 1

edges. Each node has a value associated with it, and the

root

of the tree is node

0

.

To represent this tree, you are given an integer array

nums

and a 2D array

edges

. Each

nums[i]

represents the

i

th

node's value, and each

edges[j] = [u

j

, v

j

]

represents an edge between nodes

u

j

and

v

j

in the tree.

Two values

x

and

y

are

coprime

if

gcd(x, y) == 1

where

gcd(x, y)

is the

greatest common divisor

of

x

and

y

.

An ancestor of a node

i

is any other node on the shortest path from node

i

to the

root

. A node is

not

considered an ancestor of itself.

Return

an array

ans

of size

n

,

where

ans[i]

is the closest ancestor to node

i

such that

nums[i]

and

nums[ans[i]]

are

coprime

, or

-1

if there is no such ancestor

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2,3,3,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]

Output:

[-1,0,0,1]

Explanation:

In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.
- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.
- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0. Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).
- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's
  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.
- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its
  closest valid ancestor.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [5,6,10,2,3,6,15], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]

Output:

[-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1]

Constraints:

nums.length == n

1 <= nums[i] <= 50

1 <= n <= 10

| task_id        | int     |
| subtasks_count | int     |
+----------------+---------+
task_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that task_id was divided into subtasks_count subtasks labelled from 1 to subtasks_count.
It is guaranteed that 2 <= subtasks_count <= 20.

Table:

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| task_id       | int     |
| subtask_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(task_id, subtask_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that for the task task_id, the subtask with ID subtask_id was executed successfully.
It is

guaranteed

that subtask_id <= subtasks_count for each task_id.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the missing subtasks for each

task_id

.

Return the result table in

any order

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Tasks table:
+---------+----------------+
| task_id | subtasks_count |
+---------+----------------+
| 1       | 3              |
| 2       | 2              |
| 3       | 4              |

| 2       | 1          |
| 2       | 2          |
+---------+------------+
Task 1 was divided into 3 subtasks (1, 2, 3). Only subtask 2 was executed successfully, so we include (1, 1) and (1, 3) in the answer.
Task 2 was divided into 2 subtasks (1, 2). No subtask was executed successfully, so we include (2, 1) and (2, 2) in the answer.
Task 3 was divided into 4 subtasks (1, 2, 3, 4). All of the subtasks were executed successfully.

## 1772-sort-features-by-popularity.md

# 1772. Sort Features by Popularity

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1772.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1772.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

You are given a string array

features

where

features[i]

is a single word that represents the name of a feature of the latest product you are working on. You have made a survey where users have reported which features they like. You are given a string array

responses

, where each

responses[i]

is a string containing space-separated words.

The

popularity

of a feature is the number of

responses[i]

that contain the feature. You want to sort the features in non-increasing order by their popularity. If two features have the same popularity, order them by their original index in

features

. Notice that one response could contain the same feature multiple times; this feature is only counted once in its popularity.

Return

the features in sorted order.

Example 1:

Input:

features = ["cooler","lock","touch"], responses = ["i like cooler cooler","lock touch cool","locker like touch"]

Output:

["touch","cooler","lock"]

Explanation:

appearances("cooler") = 1, appearances("lock") = 1, appearances("touch") = 2. Since "cooler" and "lock" both had 1 appearance, "cooler" comes first because "cooler" came first in the features array.

Example 2:

Input:

features = ["a","aa","b","c"], responses = ["a","a aa","a a a a a","b a"]

Output:

["a","aa","b","c"]

## 1774-closest-dessert-cost.md

# 1774. Closest Dessert Cost

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1774.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1774.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have

n

ice cream base flavors and

m

types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:

There must be

exactly one

ice cream base.

You can add

one or more

types of topping or have no toppings at all.

There are

at most two

of

each type

of topping.

You are given three inputs:

baseCosts

, an integer array of length

n

, where each

baseCosts[i]

represents the price of the

i

th

ice cream base flavor.

toppingCosts

, an integer array of length

m

, where each

toppingCosts[i]

is the price of

one

of the

i

th

topping.

target

, an integer representing your target price for dessert.

You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to

target

as possible.

Return

the closest possible cost of the dessert to

target

. If there are multiple, return

the

lower

one.

Example 1:

Input:

baseCosts = [1,7], toppingCosts = [3,4], target = 10

Output:

10

Explanation:

Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 7
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3
- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0
Total: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.

Example 2:

Input:

baseCosts = [2,3], toppingCosts = [4,5,100], target = 18

Output:

17

Explanation:

Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 3
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 4 = 4
- Take 2 of topping 1: cost 2 x 5 = 10
- Take 0 of topping 2: cost 0 x 100 = 0
Total: 3 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 17. You cannot make a dessert with a total cost of 18.

Example 3:

Input:

baseCosts = [3,10], toppingCosts = [2,5], target = 9

Output:

# 1776. Car Fleet II

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1776.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1776.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

There are

n

cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array

cars

of length

n

, where

cars[i] = [position

i

, speed

i

]

represents:

position

i

is the distance between the

i

th

car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that

position

i

< position

i+1

.

speed

i

is the initial speed of the

i

th

car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the

slowest

car in the fleet.

Return an array

answer

, where

answer[i]

is the time, in seconds, at which the

i

th

car collides with the next car, or

-1

if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within

10

-5

of the actual answers are accepted.

Example 1:

Input:

cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]

Output:

[1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]

Explanation:

After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.

Example 2:

Input:

cars = [[3,4],[5,4],[6,3],[9,1]]

## 1778-shortest-path-in-a-hidden-grid.md

# 1778. Shortest Path in a Hidden Grid

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1778.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1778.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

This is an

interactive problem

.

You are given a robot in a hidden grid, and it wants to go to a target cell in this grid. The grid is of size

m x n

, and each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked. It is

guaranteed

that the start point and the robot's destination are different, and neither of them is blocked.

You want to find the robot's minimum distance to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, or the starting point of the robot, or its target destination. You are only allowed to ask queries to your

GridMaster

object.

You are given a class

GridMaster

which you can call the following functions from:

boolean GridMaster.canMove(char direction)

returns

true

if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns

false

.

void GridMaster.move(char direction)

moves the robot in that direction. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, it will be

ignored,

and the robot would remain in the same position.

boolean GridMaster.isTarget()

returns

true

if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns

false

.

Note that

direction

in the above functions should be a character from

{'U','D','L','R'}

, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.

Return

the minimum distance between the robot's initial starting cell and the target cell if there is a path between them

. Otherwise, return

-1

.

Custom testing:

The test input is read as a 2D matrix

grid

of size

m x n

where:

grid[i][j] == -1

indicates that the robot is in cell

(i, j)

.

grid[i][j] == 0

indicates that the cell

(i, j)

is blocked.

grid[i][j] == 1

indicates that the cell

(i, j)

is empty.

grid[i][j] == 2

indicates that the cell

(i, j)

is the target cell.

There is exactly one

-1

and

2

in

grid

. Remember that you will not have this information in your code.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[1,2],[-1,0]]

Output:

2

Explanation:

One possible interaction is described below:
The robot is initially standing on cell (1, 0), denoted by the -1.
- master.canMove('U') returns True.
- master.canMove('D') returns False.
- master.canMove('L') returns False.
- master.canMove('R') returns False.
- master.move('U') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0).
- master.isTarget() returns False.
- master.canMove('U') returns False.
- master.canMove('D') returns True.
- master.canMove('L') returns False.
- master.canMove('R') returns True.
- master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (0, 1).
- master.isTarget() returns True.
We now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the shortest path to the target is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

grid = [[0,0,-1],[1,1,1],[2,0,0]]

Output:

4

Explanation:

The minimum distance between the robot and the target is 4.

Example 3:

Input:

grid = [[-1,0],[0,2]]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

There is no path from the robot to the target cell.

Constraints:

m == grid.length

n == grid[i].length

1 <= n, m <= 500

grid[i][j]

is either

-1

,

0

,

1

, or

2

.

There is

exactly one

-1

in

grid

.

There is

exactly one

2

in

grid

.

valid

if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return

the index

(0-indexed)

of the

valid

point with the smallest

Manhattan distance

from your current location

. If there are multiple, return

the valid point with the

smallest

index

. If there are no valid points, return

-1

.

The

Manhattan distance

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer

n

which denotes that the graph has

n

nodes labeled from

1

to

n

, and an array

edges

where each

edges[i] = [u

i

, v

i

, weight

i

]

denotes that there is an edge between nodes

u

i

and

v

i

with weight equal to

weight

i

.

A path from node

start

to node

end

is a sequence of nodes

[z

0

, z

1

,

z

2

, ..., z

k

]

such that

z

0

= start

and

z

k

= end

and there is an edge between

z

i

and

z

i+1

where

0 <= i <= k-1

.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let

distanceToLastNode(x)

denote the shortest distance of a path between node

n

and node

x

. A

restricted path

is a path that also satisfies that

distanceToLastNode(z

i

) > distanceToLastNode(z

i+1

)

where

0 <= i <= k-1

.

Return

the number of restricted paths from node

1

to node

n

. Since that number may be too large, return it

modulo

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

Employee

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  |  Type   |
+--------------+---------+
| employee_id  | int     |
| deprtment_id | int     |
| primary_flag | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is

'N'

.

Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |

## 1790-check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal.md

# 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1790.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1790.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

You are given two strings

s1

and

s2

of equal length. A

string swap

is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return

true

if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing

at most one string swap

on

exactly one

of the strings.

Otherwise, return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"

Output:

true

Explanation:

For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".

Example 2:

Input:

s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"

Output:

false

Explanation:

It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.

Example 3:

Input:

s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"

Output:

true

Explanation:

The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.

Example 4:

Input:

s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dcba"

Output:

false

Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100

s1.length == s2.length

s1

and

s2

consist of only lowercase English letters.

## 1797-design-authentication-manager.md

# 1797. Design Authentication Manager

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1797.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1797.html)

**Companies:** Twitter

## Description

There is an authentication system that works with authentication tokens. For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire

timeToLive

seconds after the

currentTime

. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be

extended

to expire

timeToLive

seconds after the (potentially different)

currentTime

.

Implement the

AuthenticationManager

class:

AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive)

constructs the

AuthenticationManager

and sets the

timeToLive

.

generate(string tokenId, int currentTime)

generates a new token with the given

tokenId

at the given

currentTime

in seconds.

renew(string tokenId, int currentTime)

renews the

unexpired

token with the given

tokenId

at the given

currentTime

in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given

tokenId

, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.

countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime)

returns the number of

unexpired

tokens at the given currentTime.

Note that if a token expires at time

t

, and another action happens on time

t

(

renew

or

countUnexpiredTokens

), the expiration takes place

before

the other actions.

Example 1:

Input

["AuthenticationManager", "

renew

", "generate", "

countUnexpiredTokens

", "generate", "

renew

", "

renew

", "

countUnexpiredTokens

"]

## 1801-number-of-orders-in-the-backlog.md

# 1801. Number of Orders in the Backlog

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1801.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1801.html)

**Companies:** Robinhood

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array

orders

, where each

orders[i] = [price

i

, amount

i

, orderType

i

]

denotes that

amount

i

orders have been placed of type

orderType

i

at the price

price

i

. The

orderType

i

is:

0

if it is a batch of

buy

orders, or

1

if it is a batch of

sell

orders.

Note that

orders[i]

represents a batch of

amount

i

independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by

orders[i]

will be placed before all orders represented by

orders[i+1]

for all valid

i

.

There is a

backlog

that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

If the order is a

buy

order, you look at the

sell

order with the

smallest

price in the backlog. If that

sell

order's price is

smaller than or equal to

the current

buy

order's price, they will match and be executed, and that

sell

order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the

buy

order is added to the backlog.

Vice versa, if the order is a

sell

order, you look at the

buy

order with the

largest

price in the backlog. If that

buy

order's price is

larger than or equal to

the current

sell

order's price, they will match and be executed, and that

buy

order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the

sell

order is added to the backlog.

Return

the total

amount

of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input

. Since this number can be large, return it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]

Output:

6

Explanation:

Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3

rd

order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4

th

order is added to the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.

Example 2:

Input:

orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]

Output:

999999984

Explanation:

Here is what happens with the orders:
- 10

9

orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 10

9

orders are added to the backlog.
- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (10

9

+ 7).

Constraints:

1 <= orders.length <= 10

5

orders[i].length == 3

1 <= price

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

A

trie

(pronounced as "try") or

prefix tree

is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

Trie()

Initializes the trie object.

void insert(String word)

Inserts the string

word

into the trie.

int countWordsEqualTo(String word)

Returns the number of instances of the string

word

in the trie.

int countWordsStartingWith(String prefix)

Returns the number of strings in the trie that have the string

prefix

as a prefix.

void erase(String word)

Erases the string

word

from the trie.

Example 1:

Input

["Trie", "insert", "insert", "countWordsEqualTo", "countWordsStartingWith", "erase", "countWordsEqualTo", "countWordsStartingWith", "erase", "countWordsStartingWith"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["apple"], ["app"]]

Output

[null, null, null, 2, 2, null, 1, 1, null, 0]

Explanation

Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");               // Inserts "apple".
trie.insert("apple");               // Inserts another "apple".
trie.countWordsEqualTo("apple");    // There are two instances of "apple" so return 2.
trie.countWordsStartingWith("app"); // "app" is a prefix of "apple" so return 2.
trie.erase("apple");                // Erases one "apple".
trie.countWordsEqualTo("apple");    // Now there is only one instance of "apple" so return 1.
trie.countWordsStartingWith("app"); // return 1
trie.erase("apple");                // Erases "apple". Now the trie is empty.
trie.countWordsStartingWith("app"); // return 0

Constraints:

1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000

word

and

prefix

consist only of lowercase English letters.

At most

3 * 10

4

calls

in total

will be made to

## Description

You are given a string

word

that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example,

"a123bc34d8ef34"

will become

" 123  34 8  34"

. Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space:

"123"

,

"34"

,

"8"

, and

"34"

.

Return

the number of

different

integers after performing the replacement operations on

without any leading zeros

are different.

Example 1:

Input:

word = "a

123

bc

34

d

8

ef

34

"

Output:

ââââââ. You initially have a permutation

perm

of size

n

ââ where

perm[i] == i

â

(0-indexed)

ââââ.

In one operation, you will create a new array

arr

, and for each

i

:

If

i % 2 == 0

, then

arr[i] = perm[i / 2]

.

If

i % 2 == 1

, then

arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]

.

You will then assign

arr

ââââ to

perm

.

Return

the minimum

non-zero

number of operations you need to perform on

perm

to return the permutation to its initial value.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 2

Output:

1

Explanation:

perm = [0,1] initially.

## 1807-evaluate-the-bracket-pairs-of-a-string.md

# 1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1807.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1807.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

You are given a string

s

that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a

non-empty

key.

For example, in the string

"(name)is(age)yearsold"

, there are

two

bracket pairs that contain the keys

"name"

and

"age"

.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array

knowledge

where each

knowledge[i] = [key

i

, value

i

]

indicates that key

key

i

has a value of

value

i

.

You are tasked to evaluate

all

of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key

key

i

, you will:

Replace

key

i

and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding

value

i

.

If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace

key

i

and the bracket pair with a question mark

"?"

(without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your

knowledge

. There will not be any nested brackets in

s

.

Return

the resulting string after evaluating

all

of the bracket pairs.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]

Output:

"bobistwoyearsold"

Explanation:

The key "name" has a value of "bob", so replace "(name)" with "bob".
The key "age" has a value of "two", so replace "(age)" with "two".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "hi(name)", knowledge = [["a","b"]]

Output:

"hi?"

Explanation:

As you do not know the value of the key "name", replace "(name)" with "?".

Example 3:

Input:

s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]

Output:

"yesyesyesaaa"

Explanation:

# 1808. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1808.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1808.html)

**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

You are given a positive integer

primeFactors

. You are asked to construct a positive integer

n

that satisfies the following conditions:

The number of prime factors of

n

(not necessarily distinct) is

at most

primeFactors

.

The number of nice divisors of

n

is maximized. Note that a divisor of

n

is

nice

if it is divisible by every prime factor of

n

. For example, if

n = 12

, then its prime factors are

[2,2,3]

, then

6

and

12

are nice divisors, while

3

and

4

are not.

Return

the number of nice divisors of

n

. Since that number can be too large, return it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than

1

that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number

n

is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals

n

.

Example 1:

Input:

primeFactors = 5

Output:

6

Explanation:

200 is a valid value of n.
It has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].
There is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.

## 1810-minimum-path-cost-in-a-hidden-grid.md

# 1810. Minimum Path Cost in a Hidden Grid

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1810.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1810.html)

**Companies:** Facebook, Google

## Description

This is an

interactive problem

.

There is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size

m x n

, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is

guaranteed

that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked.

Each cell has a

cost

that you need to pay each time you

move

to the cell. The starting cell's cost is

not

applied before the robot moves.

You want to find the minimum total cost to move the robot to the target cell. However, you

do not know

the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the

GridMaster

object.

The

GridMaster

class has the following functions:

boolean canMove(char direction)

Returns

true

if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns

false

.

int move(char direction)

Moves the robot in that direction and returns the cost of moving to that cell. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be

ignored

, the robot will remain in the same position, and the function will return

-1

.

boolean isTarget()

Returns

true

if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns

false

.

Note that

direction

in the above functions should be a character from

{'U','D','L','R'}

, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.

Return

the

minimum total cost

to get the robot from its initial starting cell to the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return

-1

.

Custom testing:

The test input is read as a 2D matrix

grid

of size

m x n

and four integers

r1

,

c1

,

r2

, and

c2

where:

grid[i][j] == 0

indicates that the cell

(i, j)

is blocked.

grid[i][j] >= 1

indicates that the cell

(i, j)

is empty and

grid[i][j]

is the

cost

to move to that cell.

(r1, c1)

is the starting cell of the robot.

(r2, c2)

is the target cell of the robot.

Remember that you will

not

have this information in your code.

Example 1:

Input:

grid = [[2,3],[1,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 1, r2 = 1, c2 = 0

Output:

2

Explanation:

One possible interaction is described below:
The robot is initially standing on cell (0, 1), denoted by the 3.
- master.canMove('U') returns false.
- master.canMove('D') returns true.
- master.canMove('L') returns true.
- master.canMove('R') returns false.
- master.move('L') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0) and returns 2.
- master.isTarget() returns false.
- master.canMove('U') returns false.
- master.canMove('D') returns true.
- master.canMove('L') returns false.
- master.canMove('R') returns true.
- master.move('D') moves the robot to the cell (1, 0) and returns 1.
- master.isTarget() returns true.
- master.move('L') doesn't move the robot and returns -1.
- master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (1, 1) and returns 1.
We now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the minimum total cost to reach it is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

grid = [[0,3,1],[3,4,2],[1,2,0]], r1 = 2, c1 = 0, r2 = 0, c2 = 2

Output:

9

Explanation:

The minimum cost path is (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2).

Example 3:

Input:

grid = [[1,0],[0,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 0, r2 = 1, c2 = 1

Output:

-1

Explanation:

There is no path from the robot to the target cell.

Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 100

m == grid.length

n == grid[i].length

0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

Contests

+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| contest_id   | int  |
| gold_medal   | int  |
| silver_medal | int  |
| bronze_medal | int  |
+--------------+------+
contest_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the LeetCode contest ID and the user IDs of the gold, silver, and bronze medalists.
It is guaranteed that any consecutive contests have consecutive IDs and that no ID is skipped.

Table:

Users

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| mail        | varchar |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the users.

Write an SQL query to report the

name

and the

mail

of all

interview candidates

. A user is an

interview candidate

if

at least one

of these two conditions is true:

The user won

any

medal in

three or more consecutive

contests.

The user won the

gold

medal in

three or more different

contests (not necessarily consecutive).

Return the result table in

any order

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Contests table:
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
| contest_id | gold_medal | silver_medal | bronze_medal |
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 190        | 1          | 5            | 2            |

| 192        | 5          | 2            | 3            |
| 193        | 1          | 3            | 5            |
| 194        | 4          | 5            | 2            |
| 195        | 4          | 2            | 1            |
| 196        | 1          | 5            | 2            |
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+

Users table:
+---------+--------------------+-------+
| user_id | mail               | name  |
+---------+--------------------+-------+
| 1       | sarah@leetcode.com | Sarah |
| 2       | bob@leetcode.com   | Bob   |
| 3       | alice@leetcode.com | Alice |
| 4       | hercy@leetcode.com | Hercy |
| 5       | quarz@leetcode.com | Quarz |
+---------+--------------------+-------+

Result table:
+-------+--------------------+
| name  | mail               |
+-------+--------------------+
| Sarah | sarah@leetcode.com |
| Bob   | bob@leetcode.com   |
| Alice | alice@leetcode.com |
| Quarz | quarz@leetcode.com |
+-------+--------------------+

Sarah won 3 gold medals (190, 193, and 196), so we include her in the result table.
Bob won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (190, 191, and 192), so we include him in the result table.
    - Note that he also won a medal in 3 other consecutive contests (194, 195, and 196).
Alice won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (191, 192, and 193), so we include her in the result table.
Quarz won a medal in 5 consecutive contests (190, 191, 192, 193, and 194), so we include them in the result table.

Follow up:

What if the first condition changed to be "any medal in

n

or more

consecutive contests"? How would you change your solution to get the interview candidates? Imagine that

n

is the parameter of a stored procedure.

Some users may not participate in every contest but still perform well in the ones they do. How would you change your solution to only consider contests where the user

was a participant

? Suppose the registered users for each contest are given in another table.

## Description

A

sentence

is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of

only

uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

For example,

"Hello World"

,

"HELLO"

, and

"hello world hello world"

are all sentences.

You are given a sentence

s

**Companies:** Twitter

## Description

You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer

k

. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array

logs

where each

logs[i] = [ID

i

, time

i

]

indicates that the user with

ID

i

performed an action at the minute

time

i

.

Multiple users

can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform

multiple actions

in the same minute.

The

user active minutes (UAM)

for a given user is defined as the

number of unique minutes

in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a

1-indexed

array

answer

of size

k

such that, for each

j

(

1 <= j <= k

),

answer[j]

is the

number of users

whose

UAM

equals

j

.

Return

the array

answer

as described above

.

Example 1:

Input:

logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5

Output:

[0,2,0,0,0]

Explanation:

The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).
The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.

Example 2:

Input:

logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4

Output:

[1,1,0,0]

Explanation:

The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.
The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.
Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.

Constraints:

1 <= logs.length <= 10

4

0 <= ID

i

<= 10

9

1 <= time

i

<= 10

5

k

is in the range

[The maximum

UAM

for a user, 10

5

]

# 1818. Minimum Absolute Sum Difference

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1818.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1818.html)

**Companies:** Uber

## Description

You are given two positive integer arrays

nums1

and

nums2

, both of length

n

.

The

absolute sum difference

of arrays

nums1

and

nums2

is defined as the

sum

of

|nums1[i] - nums2[i]|

for each

0 <= i < n

(

0-indexed

).

You can replace

at most one

element of

nums1

with

any

other element in

nums1

to

minimize

the absolute sum difference.

Return the

minimum absolute sum difference

after

replacing at most one

element in the array

nums1

.

Since the answer may be large, return it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

|x|

is defined as:

x

if

x >= 0

, or

-x

if

x < 0

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]

Output:

3

Explanation:

There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,

7

,5] => [1,

1

,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,

7

,5] => [1,

5

,5].
Both will yield an absolute sum difference of

|1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| =

3.

Example 2:

Input:

nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]

Output:

0

Explanation:

nums1 is equal to nums2 so no replacement is needed. This will result in an
absolute sum difference of 0.

Example 3:

Input:

nums1 = [1,10,4,4,2,7], nums2 = [9,3,5,1,7,4]

Output:

20

Explanation:

Replace the first element with the second: [

1

,10,4,4,2,7] => [

10

,10,4,4,2,7].
This yields an absolute sum difference of

|10-9| + |10-3| + |4-5| + |4-1| + |2-7| + |7-4| = 20

Constraints:

n == nums1.length

n == nums2.length

1 <= n <= 10

5

1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10

# 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1823.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1823.html)

**Companies:** Bloomberg

## Description

There are

n

friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from

1

to

n

in

clockwise order

. More formally, moving clockwise from the

i

th

friend brings you to the

(i+1)

th

friend for

1 <= i < n

, and moving clockwise from the

n

th

friend brings you to the

1

st

friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

Start

at the

1

st

friend.

Count the next

k

friends in the clockwise direction

including

the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.

The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.

If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step

2

starting

from the friend

immediately clockwise

of the friend who just lost and repeat.

Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

Given the number of friends,

n

, and an integer

k

, return

the winner of the game

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5, k = 2

Output:

3

Explanation:

Here are the steps of the game:
1) Start at friend 1.
2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 6, k = 5

Output:

1

Explanation:

The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. The winner is friend 1.

## 1824-minimum-sideway-jumps.md

# 1824. Minimum Sideway Jumps

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1824.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1824.html)

**Companies:** Pony.ai

## Description

There is a

3 lane road

of length

n

that consists of

n + 1

points

labeled from

0

to

n

. A frog

starts

at point

0

in the

second

lane

and wants to jump to point

n

. However, there could be obstacles along the way.

You are given an array

obstacles

of length

n + 1

where each

obstacles[i]

(

ranging from 0 to 3

) describes an obstacle on the lane

obstacles[i]

at point

i

. If

obstacles[i] == 0

, there are no obstacles at point

i

. There will be

at most one

obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.

For example, if

obstacles[2] == 1

, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point

i

to point

i + 1

on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point

i + 1

. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a

side jump

to jump to

another

lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the

same

point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.

For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.

Return

the

minimum number of side jumps

the frog needs to reach

any lane

at point n starting from lane

2

at point 0.

Note:

There will be no obstacles on points

0

and

n

.

Example 1:

Input:

obstacles = [0,1,2,3,0]

Output:

2

Explanation:

The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).
Note that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).

Example 2:

Input:

obstacles = [0,1,1,3,3,0]

Output:

0

Explanation:

There are no obstacles on lane 2. No side jumps are required.

Example 3:

Input:

obstacles = [0,2,1,0,3,0]

Output:

2

Explanation:

The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps.

Constraints:

## Description

You are given two integers,

m

and

k

, and a stream of integers. You are tasked to implement a data structure that calculates the

MKAverage

for the stream.

The

MKAverage

can be calculated using these steps:

If the number of the elements in the stream is less than

m

you should consider the

MKAverage

to be

-1

. Otherwise, copy the last

m

elements of the stream to a separate container.

Remove the smallest

k

elements and the largest

k

elements from the container.

Calculate the average value for the rest of the elements

rounded down to the nearest integer

.

Implement the

MKAverage

class:

MKAverage(int m, int k)

Initializes the

MKAverage

object with an empty stream and the two integers

m

and

k

.

void addElement(int num)

Inserts a new element

num

into the stream.

int calculateMKAverage()

Calculates and returns the

MKAverage

Explanation

MKAverage obj = new MKAverage(3, 1);
obj.addElement(3);        // current elements are [3]
obj.addElement(1);        // current elements are [3,1]
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // return -1, because m = 3 and only 2 elements exist.
obj.addElement(10);       // current elements are [3,1,10]
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [3,1,10].
                          // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be

[3].
                          // The average of [3] equals 3/1 = 3, return 3

## 1826-faulty-sensor.md

# 1826. Faulty Sensor

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1826.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1826.html)

**Companies:** Facebook

## Description

An experiment is being conducted in a lab. To ensure accuracy, there are

two

sensors collecting data simultaneously. You are given 2 arrays

sensor1

and

sensor2

, where

sensor1[i]

and

sensor2[i]

are the

i

th

data points collected by the two sensors.

However, this type of sensor has a chance of being defective, which causes

exactly one

data point to be dropped. After the data is dropped, all the data points to the

right

of the dropped data are

shifted

one place to the left, and the last data point is replaced with some

random value

. It is guaranteed that this random value will

not

be equal to the dropped value.

For example, if the correct data is

[1,2,

3

,4,5]

and

3

is dropped, the sensor could return

[1,2,4,5,

7

]

(the last position can be

any

value, not just

7

).

We know that there is a defect in

at most one

of the sensors. Return

the sensor number (

1

or

2

) with the defect. If there is

no defect

in either sensor or if it is

impossible

to determine the defective sensor, return

-1

.

Example 1:

Input:

sensor1 = [2,3,4,5], sensor2 = [2,1,3,4]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Sensor 2 has the correct values.
The second data point from sensor 2 is dropped, and the last value of sensor 1 is replaced by a 5.

Example 2:

Input:

sensor1 = [2,2,2,2,2], sensor2 = [2,2,2,2,5]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

It is impossible to determine which sensor has a defect.
Dropping the last value for either sensor could produce the output for the other sensor.

Example 3:

Input:

sensor1 = [2,3,2,2,3,2], sensor2 = [2,3,2,3,2,7]

Output:

2

Explanation:

Sensor 1 has the correct values.
The fourth data point from sensor 1 is dropped, and the last value of sensor 1 is replaced by a 7.

Constraints:

sensor1.length == sensor2.length

1 <= sensor1.length <= 100

1 <= sensor1[i], sensor2[i] <= 100

| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| transaction_id | int      |
| day            | datetime |
| amount         | int      |
+----------------+----------+
transaction_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about one transaction.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the transactions with the

maximum

amount

on their respective day. If in one day there are multiple such transactions, return all of them.

Return the result table

in ascending order by

transaction_id

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Transactions table:
+----------------+--------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | day                | amount |
+----------------+--------------------+--------+
| 8              | 2021-4-3 15:57:28  | 57     |
| 9              | 2021-4-28 08:47:25 | 21     |
| 1              | 2021-4-29 13:28:30 | 58     |
| 5              | 2021-4-28 16:39:59 | 40     |
| 6              | 2021-4-29 23:39:28 | 58     |

| 5              |
| 6              |
| 8              |
+----------------+
"2021-4-3"  --> We have one transaction with ID 8, so we add 8 to the result table.
"2021-4-28" --> We have two transactions with IDs 5 and 9. The transaction with ID 5 has an amount of 40, while the transaction with ID 9 has an amount of 21. We only include the transaction with ID 5 as it has the maximum amount this day.
"2021-4-29" --> We have two transactions with IDs 1 and 6. Both transactions have the same amount of 58, so we include both in the result table.
We order the result table by transaction_id after collecting these IDs.

ââââââth

ââââ task will be available to process at

enqueueTime

i

and will take

processingTime

i

to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process

at most one

task at a time and will act in the following way:

If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.

If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the

shortest processing time

. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.

Once a task is started, the CPU will

process the entire task

without stopping.

The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return

the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

Example 1:

Input:

tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]

Output:

[0,2,3,1]

Explanation:

The events go as follows:
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.

Example 2:

Input:

tasks = [[7,10],[7,12],[7,5],[7,4],[7,2]]

Output:

[4,3,2,0,1]

Explanation

## Description

A string is considered

beautiful

if it satisfies the following conditions:

Each of the 5 English vowels (

'a'

,

'e'

,

'i'

,

'o'

,

'u'

) must appear

at least once

in it.

The letters must be sorted in

alphabetical order

(i.e. all

'a'

s before

'e'

s, all

'e'

s before

'i'

s, etc.).

For example, strings

"aeiou"

and

"aaaaaaeiiiioou"

are considered

beautiful

, but

"uaeio"

n

.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.

The height of the first building

must

be

0

.

The height difference between any two adjacent buildings

cannot exceed

1

.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array

restrictions

# 1841. League Statistics

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1841.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1841.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

SQL Schema

Table:

Teams

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| team_id        | int     |
| team_name      | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
team_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about one team in the league.

Table:

Matches

+-----------------+---------+
| Column Name     | Type    |
+-----------------+---------+
| home_team_id    | int     |
| away_team_id    | int     |
| home_team_goals | int     |
| away_team_goals | int     |
+-----------------+---------+
(home_team_id, away_team_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about one match.
home_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the home team.
away_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the away team.
The winner of the match is the team with the higher number of goals.

Write an SQL query to report the statistics of the league. The statistics should be built using the played matches where the

winning

team gets

three points

and the

losing

team gets

no points

. If a match ends with a

draw

, both teams get

one point

.

Each row of the result table should contain:

team_name

- The name of the team in the

Teams

table.

matches_played

- The number of matches played as either a home or away team.

points

- The total points the team has so far.

goal_for

- The total number of goals scored by the team across all matches.

goal_against

- The total number of goals scored by opponent teams against this team across all matches.

goal_diff

- The result of

goal_for - goal_against

.

Return the result table

in descending order by

points

. If two or more teams have the same

points

, order them

in descending order by

goal_diff

. If there is still a tie, order them by

team_name

in

lexicographical order

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Teams table:
+---------+-----------+
| team_id | team_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 1       | Ajax      |
| 4       | Dortmund  |
| 6       | Arsenal   |
+---------+-----------+

Matches table:
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |
| 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |
| 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |
| 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+


Result table:
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against | goal_diff |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4         |
| Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0         |
| Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4        |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+

Ajax (team_id=1) played 4 matches: 2 losses and 2 draws. Total points = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund (team_id=4) played 2 matches: 2 wins. Total points = 3 + 3 = 6.
Arsenal (team_id=6) played 2 matches: 2 draws. Total points = 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund is the first team in the table. Ajax and Arsenal have the same points, but since Arsenal has a higher goal_diff than Ajax, Arsenal comes before Ajax in the table.

two or more consecutive

months. The

total income

of an account in some month is the sum of all its deposits in that month (i.e., transactions of the type

'Creditor'

).

Return the result table

in ascending order by

transaction_id

.

The query result format is in the following example:

Accounts table:

| 1              | 4          | Creditor | 49300  | 2021-05-03 16:11:04 |
| 15             | 3          | Debtor   | 75500  | 2021-05-23 14:40:20 |
| 10             | 3          | Creditor | 102100 | 2021-06-15 10:37:16 |
| 14             | 4          | Creditor | 56300  | 2021-07-21 12:12:25 |
| 19             | 4          | Debtor   | 101100 | 2021-05-09 15:21:49 |
| 8              | 3          | Creditor | 64900  | 2021-07-26 15:09:56 |
| 7              | 3          | Creditor | 90900  | 2021-06-14 11:23:07 |
+----------------+------------+----------+--------+---------------------+

Result table:
+------------+
| account_id |
+------------+
| 3          |
+------------+

For account 3:
- In 6-2021, the user had an income of 107100 + 102100 + 90900 = 300100.
- In 7-2021, the user had an income of 64900.
We can see that the income exceeded the max income of 21000 for two consecutive months, so we include 3 in the result table.

For account 4:
- In 5-2021, the user had an income of 49300.
- In 6-2021, the user had an income of 10400.
- In 7-2021, the user had an income of 56300.
We can see that the income exceeded the max income in May and July, but not in June. Since the account did not exceed the max income for two consecutive months, we do not include it in the result table.

# 1846. Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1846.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1846.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

You are given an array of positive integers

arr

. Perform some operations (possibly none) on

arr

so that it satisfies these conditions:

The value of the

first

element in

arr

must be

1

.

The absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements must be

less than or equal to

1

. In other words,

abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) <= 1

for each

i

where

1 <= i < arr.length

(

0-indexed

).

abs(x)

is the absolute value of

x

.

There are 2 types of operations that you can perform any number of times:

Decrease

the value of any element of

arr

to a

smaller positive integer

.

Rearrange

the elements of

arr

to be in any order.

Return

the

maximum

possible value of an element in

arr

after performing the operations to satisfy the conditions

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [2,2,1,2,1]

Output:

2

Explanation:

We can satisfy the conditions by rearranging

arr

so it becomes

[1,2,2,2,1]

.
The largest element in

arr

is 2.

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [100,1,1000]

Output:

3

Explanation:

One possible way to satisfy the conditions is by doing the following:
1. Rearrange

arr

so it becomes

[1,100,1000]

.
2. Decrease the value of the second element to 2.
3. Decrease the value of the third element to 3.
Now

arr = [1,2,3], which

satisfies the conditions.
The largest element in

arr is 3.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output:

5

Explanation:

The array already satisfies the conditions, and the largest element is 5.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10

# 1847. Closest Room

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1847.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1847.html)

**Companies:** Amazon

## Description

There is a hotel with

n

rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array

rooms

where

rooms[i] = [roomId

i

, size

i

]

denotes that there is a room with room number

roomId

i

and size equal to

size

i

. Each

roomId

i

is guaranteed to be

unique

.

You are also given

k

queries in a 2D array

queries

where

queries[j] = [preferred

j

, minSize

j

]

. The answer to the

j

th

query is the room number

id

of a room such that:

The room has a size of

at least

minSize

j

, and

abs(id - preferred

j

)

is

minimized

, where

abs(x)

is the absolute value of

x

.

If there is a

tie

in the absolute difference, then use the room with the

smallest

such

id

. If there is

no such room

, the answer is

-1

.

Return

an array

answer

of length

k

where

answer[j]

contains the answer to the

j

th

query

.

Example 1:

Input:

rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]

Output:

[3,-1,3]

Explanation:

The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [3,1]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.
Query = [3,3]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.
Query = [5,2]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.

## 1848-minimum-distance-to-the-target-element.md

# 1848. Minimum Distance to the Target Element

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1848.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1848.html)

**Companies:** Honeywell

## Description

Given an integer array

nums

(0-indexed)

and two integers

target

and

start

, find an index

i

such that

nums[i] == target

and

abs(i - start)

is

minimized

. Note that

abs(x)

is the absolute value of

x

.

Return

abs(i - start)

.

It is

guaranteed

that

target

exists in

nums

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 5, start = 3

Output:

1

Explanation:

nums[4] = 5 is the only value equal to target, so the answer is abs(4 - 3) = 1.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1], target = 1, start = 0

Output:

0

Explanation:

nums[0] = 1 is the only value equal to target, so the answer is abs(0 - 0) = 0.

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], target = 1, start = 0

Output:

0

Explanation:

Every value of nums is 1, but nums[0] minimizes abs(i - start), which is abs(0 - 0) = 0.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000

1 <= nums[i] <= 10

4

0 <= start < nums.length

target

is in

nums

## 1849-splitting-a-string-into-descending-consecutive-values.md

# 1849. Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1849.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1849.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

You are given a string

s

that consists of only digits.

Check if we can split

s

into

two or more non-empty substrings

such that the

numerical values

of the substrings are in

descending order

and the

difference

between numerical values of every two

adjacent

substrings

is equal to

1

.

For example, the string

s = "0090089"

can be split into

["0090", "089"]

with numerical values

[90,89]

. The values are in descending order and adjacent values differ by

1

, so this way is valid.

Another example, the string

s = "001"

can be split into

["0", "01"]

,

["00", "1"]

, or

["0", "0", "1"]

. However all the ways are invalid because they have numerical values

[0,1]

,

[0,1]

, and

[0,0,1]

respectively, all of which are not in descending order.

Return

true

if it is possible to split

s

ââââââ

as described above

, or

false

otherwise.

A

substring

is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "1234"

Output:

false

Explanation:

There is no valid way to split s.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "050043"

Output:

true

Explanation:

s can be split into ["05", "004", "3"] with numerical values [5,4,3].
The values are in descending order with adjacent values differing by 1.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "9080701"

Output:

false

Explanation:

There is no valid way to split s.

Example 4:

Input:

s = "10009998"

Output:

true

Explanation:

s can be split into ["100", "099", "98"] with numerical values [100,99,98].
The values are in descending order with adjacent values differing by 1.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20

s

only consists of digits.
