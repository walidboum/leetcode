## Description

Given two words (

beginWord

and

endWord

), and a dictionary's word list,
        find the length of shortest transformation sequence from

beginWord

to

endWord

, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.

Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that

beginWord

is

not

a transformed word.

Note:

Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.

All words have the same length.

All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

You may assume no duplicates in the word list.

You may assume

beginWord

and

endWord

are non-empty and are not the
            same.

Example 1:

Input:

beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:

5

Explanation:

As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Example 2:

Input:

beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output:

0

Explanation:

The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible

transformation.
