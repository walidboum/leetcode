**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon

## Description

Let

f(x)

be the number of zeroes at the end of

x!

. (Recall that

x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x

, and by convention,

0! = 1

.)

For example,

f(3) = 0

because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while

f(11)
        = 2

because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given

K

, find how
        many non-negative integers

x

have the property that

f(x) = K

.

Example 1:

Input:

K = 0

Output:

5

Explanation:

0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.

Example 2:

Input:

K = 5

Output:

0

Explanation:

There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.

Note:

K

will be an integer in the range

[0, 10^9]

.
