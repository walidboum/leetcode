and

1

. That is,

F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.

Given

N

, calculate

F(N)

.

Example 1:

Input:

2

Output:

1

Explanation:

F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

Example 2:

Input:

3

Output:

2

Explanation:

F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Example 3:

Input:

4

Output:

3

Explanation:

F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
