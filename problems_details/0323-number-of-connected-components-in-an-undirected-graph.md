## Description

Given

n

nodes labeled from

0

to

n - 1

and a list of
        undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of
        connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5

and

edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4

Output:

2

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5

and

edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:

1

Note:

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in

edges

. Since all edges
        are undirected,

[0, 1]

is the same as

[1, 0]

and thus will not
        appear together in

edges

.
