        (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:

Input:

intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]

Output:

[[1,5],[6,9]]

Example 2:

Input:

intervals =

[[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]]

, newInterval =

[4,8]

Output:

[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]

Explanation:

Because the new interval

[4,8]

overlaps with

[3,5],[6,7],[8,10]

.
