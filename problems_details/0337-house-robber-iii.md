## Description

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to
        this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one
        parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place
        forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked
        houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the
        police.
