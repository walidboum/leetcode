## Description

Given a string

s

, a

k

duplicate removal

consists
        of choosing

k

adjacent and equal letters from

s

and
        removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to
        concatenate together.

We repeatedly make

k

duplicate removals on

s

until we no longer
        can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "abcd", k = 2

Output:

"abcd"

Explanation:

There's nothing to delete.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3

Output:

"aa"

Explanation:

First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"

Example 3:

Input:

s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2

Output:

"ps"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5

2 <= k <= 10^4

s

only contains lower case English letters.
