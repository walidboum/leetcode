## Description

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node

root

, return the
        minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Example :

Input:

root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \
    1   3

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.

Note:

The size of the BST will be between 2 and

100

.

The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value
            is different.
