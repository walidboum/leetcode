## Description

You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9. You need to judge whether they could
        operated through

to get the value of 24.

Example 1:

Input:

[4, 1, 8, 7]

Output:

True

Explanation:

(8-4) * (7-1) = 24

Example 2:

Input:

[1, 2, 1, 2]

Output:

False

Note:

The division operator

/

represents real division, not integer division. For
            example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.

Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use

-

as a unary operator. For example, with

[1, 1, 1, 1]

as input, the
            expression

-1 - 1 - 1 - 1

is not allowed.

You cannot concatenate numbers together. For example, if the input is

[1, 2, 1,
            2]

, we cannot write this as 12 + 12.
