## Description

Given two non-empty binary trees

s

and

t

, check whether tree

t

has
        exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of

s

. A subtree of

s

is a tree consists of a node in

s

and all of this node's descendants. The tree

s

could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:

Given tree s:

3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2

Given tree t:

4
  / \
 1   2

Return

true

, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.

Example 2:

Given tree s:

3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0

Given tree t:

4
  / \
