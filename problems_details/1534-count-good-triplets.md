## Description

Given an array of integers

arr

, and three integers

a

,

b

and

c

.
            You need to find the number of good triplets.

A triplet

(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])

is

good

if the
                following conditions are true:

0 <= i < j < k <Â arr.length

|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a

|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b

|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c

Where

|x|

denotes the absolute value of

x

.

Return

the number of good triplets

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [3,0,1,1,9,7], a = 7, b = 2, c = 3

Output:

4

Explanation:

There are 4 good triplets: [(3,0,1), (3,0,1), (3,1,1), (0,1,1)].

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,1,2,2,3], a = 0, b = 0, c = 1

Output:

0

Explanation:

No triplet satisfies all conditions.

Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 100

0 <= arr[i] <= 1000

0 <= a, b, c <= 1000

Difficulty:

Easy
