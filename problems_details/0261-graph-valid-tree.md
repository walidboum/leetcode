## Description

Given

n

nodes labeled from

0

to

n-1

and a list of
        undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these
        edges make up a valid tree.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5

, and

edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

n = 5,

and

edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]

Output:

false

Note

: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in

edges

. Since
        all edges are undirected,

[0,1]

is the same as

[1,0]

and thus will
        not appear together in

edges

.
