## Description

Given an array

A

of positive integers, call a (contiguous, not necessarily
        distinct) subarray of

A

good

if the number of different integers in
        that subarray is exactly

K

.

(For example,

[1,2,3,1,2]

has

3

different integers:

1

,

2

, and

3

.)

Return the number of good subarrays of

A

.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

[1,2,1,2,3]

, K =

2

Output:

7

Explanation:

Subarrays formed with exactly 2 different integers: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,1,2].

Example 2:

Input:

A =

[1,2,1,3,4]

, K =

3

Output:

3

Explanation:

Subarrays formed with exactly 3 different integers: [1,2,1,3], [2,1,3], [1,3,4].

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 20000

1 <= A[i] <= A.length

1 <= K <= A.length
