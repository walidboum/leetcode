## Description

Given an array

A

of

0

s and

1

s, consider

N_i

: the i-th subarray from

A[0]

to

A[i]

interpretedÂ as
        a binary number (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit.)

Return a list of booleans

answer

, where

answer[i]

is

true

if
        and only if

N_i

is divisible by 5.

Example 1:

Input:

[0,1,1]

Output:

[true,false,false]

Explanation:

The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.  Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,1,1]

Output:

[false,false,false]

Example 3:

Input:

[0,1,1,1,1,1]

Output:

[true,false,false,false,true,false]

Example 4:

Input:

[1,1,1,0,1]

Output:

[false,false,false,false,false]

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 30000

A[i]

is

0

or

1

Difficulty:

Easy

Lock:
