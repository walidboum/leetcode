## Description

Given an array

nums

of

distinct

positive integers,
            return

the number of tuples

(a, b, c, d)

such that

a
                * b = c * d

where

a

,

b

,

c

,
                and

d

are elements of

nums

,
                and

a != b != c != d

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2,3,4,6]

Output:

8

Explanation:

There are 8 valid tuples:
(2,6,3,4) , (2,6,4,3) , (6,2,3,4) , (6,2,4,3)
(3,4,2,6) , (4,3,2,6) , (3,4,6,2) , (4,3,6,2)

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,2,4,5,10]

Output:

16

(4,5,2,10) , (4,5,10,2) , (5,4,2,10) , (5,4,10,2)

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [2,3,4,6,8,12]

Output:

40

Example 4:

Input:

nums = [2,3,5,7]

Output:

0

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
