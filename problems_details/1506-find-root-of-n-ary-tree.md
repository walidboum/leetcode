## Description

Given all the nodes of an

N-ary
            tree

as an array

Node[] tree

where each node has a

unique
            value

.

Find and return the

root

of the N-ary tree.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal,
                each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Follow up:

Can you find the root of the tree with O(1) additional
                memory space?

Notes:

The following input is only given to testing purposes.

You will receive as input a list of all nodes of the n-ary tree in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

Output:

[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

Example 2:

Input:

[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

Output:

[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

Constraints:

The total number of nodes is between

[1, 5*10^4]

.

Each node has a unique value.
