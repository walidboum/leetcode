## Description

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced
        BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the
        depth of the two subtrees of

every

node never differ by more than 1.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```
