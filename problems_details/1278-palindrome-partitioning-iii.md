## Description

You are given a string

s

containing lowercase letters and an
            integer

k

. You need to :

First, change some characters of

s

to other lowercase English
                    letters.

Then divide

s

into

k

non-empty disjoint
                    substrings such that each substring is palindrome.

Return the minimal number of characters that you need to changeÂ to divide the
                string.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "abc", k = 2

Output:

1

Explanation:

You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and change 1 character in "ab" to make it palindrome.

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aabbc", k = 3

Output:

0

Explanation:

You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and "c", all of them are palindrome.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "leetcode", k = 8

Output:

0

Constraints:

1 <= k <= s.length <= 100

.
