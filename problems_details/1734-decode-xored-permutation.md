## Description

There is an integer array

perm

that is a permutation of the first

n

positive integers, where

n

is always

odd

.

It was encoded into another integer array

encoded

of length

n -
                1

, such that

encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]

. For example,
                if

perm = [1,3,2]

, then

encoded = [2,1]

.

Given the

encoded

array, return

the original array

perm

. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.

Example 1:

Input:

encoded = [3,1]

Output:

[1,2,3]

Explanation:

If perm = [1,2,3], then encoded = [1 XOR 2,2 XOR 3] = [3,1]

Example 2:

Input:

encoded = [6,5,4,6]

Output:

[2,4,1,5,3]

Constraints:

3 <= n <Â 10

5

n

is odd.

encoded.length == n - 1

Difficulty:

Medium

Lock:

Normal
