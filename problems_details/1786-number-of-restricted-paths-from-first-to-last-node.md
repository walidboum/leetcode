## Description

There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer

n

which denotes that the graph has

n

nodes labeled from

1

to

n

, and an array

edges

where each

edges[i] = [u

i

, v

i

, weight

i

]

denotes that there is an edge between nodes

u

i

and

v

i

with weight equal to

weight

i

.

A path from node

start

to node

end

is a sequence of nodes

[z

0

, z

1

,

z

2

, ..., z

k

]

such that

z

0

= start

and

z

k

= end

and there is an edge between

z

i

and

z

i+1

where

0 <= i <= k-1

.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let

distanceToLastNode(x)

denote the shortest distance of a path between node

n

and node

x

. A

restricted path

is a path that also satisfies that

distanceToLastNode(z

i

) > distanceToLastNode(z

i+1

)

where

0 <= i <= k-1

.

Return

the number of restricted paths from node

1

to node

n

. Since that number may be too large, return it

modulo

10

9

+ 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 5, edges = [[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[2,3,1],[1,4,2],[5,2,2],[3,5,1],[5,4,10]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

Each circle contains the node number in black and its

distanceToLastNode value in blue.

The three restricted paths are:
1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
3) 1 --> 3 --> 5

Example 2:

Input:

n = 7, edges = [[1,3,1],[4,1,2],[7,3,4],[2,5,3],[5,6,1],[6,7,2],[7,5,3],[2,6,4]]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Each circle contains the node number in black and its

distanceToLastNode value in blue.

The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2 * 10

4

n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4 * 10

edges[i].length == 3

1 <= u

!= v

i

1 <= weight

i

<= 10

5

There is at most one edge between any two nodes.

There is at least one path between any two nodes.
