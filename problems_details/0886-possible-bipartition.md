## Description

Given a set of

N

people (numbered

1, 2, ..., N

), we would like
        to split everyone into two groups of

any

size.

Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same
        group.

Formally, if

dislikes[i] = [a, b]

, it means it is not allowed to put the people
        numbered

a

and

b

into the same group.

Return

true

if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups
        in this way.
