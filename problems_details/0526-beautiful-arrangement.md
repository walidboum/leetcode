## Description

Suppose you have

N

integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array
        that is constructed by these

N

numbers successfully if one of the following is true
        for the i

th

position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

The number at the i

th

position is divisible by

i

.

i

is divisible by the number at the i

th

position.

Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:

Input:

2

Output:

2

Explanation:

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.

Note:

N

is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.
