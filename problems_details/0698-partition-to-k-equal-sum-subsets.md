## Description

Given an array of integers

nums

and a positive integer

k

, find
        whether it's possible to divide this array into

k

non-empty subsets whose
        sums are all equal.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4

Output:

True

Explanation:

It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

Note:

1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16

.

0 < nums[i] < 10000

.
