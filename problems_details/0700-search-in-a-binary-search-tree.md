## Description

Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in
        the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with
        that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example,

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2

You should return this subtree:

2
     / \
    1   3

In the example above, if we want to search the value

5

, since there is no node
        with value

5

, we should return

NULL

.

Note that an empty tree is represented by

NULL

, therefore you would see the
        expected output (serialized tree format) as

[]

, not

null

.
