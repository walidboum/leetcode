## Description

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only
        access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

Example 1:

Input:

head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5

Output:

[4,1,9]

Explanation:

You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

Example 2:

Input:

head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1

Output:

[4,5,9]

Explanation:

You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

Note:

The linked list will have at least two elements.

All of the nodes' values will be unique.

The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the
            linked list.

Do not return anything from your function.
