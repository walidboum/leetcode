## Description

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:

"tree"

Output:

"eert"

Explanation:

'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input:

"cccaaa"

Output:

"cccaaa"

Explanation:

Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

Input:

"Aabb"

Output:

"bbAa"

Explanation:

"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
