## Description

There are two sorted arrays

nums1

and

nums2

of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log
        (m+n)).

You may assume

nums1

and

nums2

cannot be both empty.

Example 1:

nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0

Example 2:

nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
