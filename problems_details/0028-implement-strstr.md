## Description

Implement

strStr()

.

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or

-1

if
        needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input:

haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"

Output:

2

Example 2:

Input:

haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"

Output:

-1

Clarification:

What should we return when

needle

is an empty string? This is a great question
        to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when

needle

is an empty
        string. This is consistent to C's

strstr()

and Java's

indexOf()

.
