## Description

A

binary expression tree

is a kind of binary
            tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has
            either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands
            (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators

'+'

(addition),

'-'

(subtraction),

'*'

(multiplication), and

'/'

(division).

For each internal node with operator

o

, the

infix
                expression

that it represents is

(A o B)

, where

A

is the expression the left subtree represents and

B

is
                the expression the right subtree represents.

You are given a string

s

, an

infix expression

containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses

'('

and

')'

.

Return

the

binary expression tree

,Â which its

in-order
                traversal

reproduce

s

.

Please note that order of operations applies
                in

s

.

That is, expressions in parentheses are
                evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and
                subtraction.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "2-3/(5*2)+1"

Output:

[+,-,1,2,/,null,null,null,null,3,*,null,null,5,2]

Example 2:

Input:

s = "3*4-2*5"

Output:

[-,*,*,3,4,2,5]

Example 3:

Input:

s = "1+2+3+4+5"

Output:

[+,+,5,+,4,null,null,+,3,null,null,1,2]

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10

5

s

consists of digits and the characters

'+'

,

'-'

,

'*'

,

'/'

,

'('

, and

')'

.

Operands in

s

are

exactly

1 digit.

It is guaranteed that

s

is a valid expression.
