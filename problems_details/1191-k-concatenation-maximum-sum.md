**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

Given an integer array

arr

and an integer

k

, modify the array
        by repeating it

k

times.

For example, if

arrÂ = [1, 2]

and

k = 3

then the modified array
        will be

[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

.

Return the maximum sub-array sum in the modified array. Note that the length of the sub-array
        can be

0

and its sum in that case is

0

.

As the answer can be very large, return the answer

modulo

10^9
        + 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [1,2], k = 3

Output:

9

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,-2,1], k = 5

Output:

2

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [-1,-2], k = 7

Output:

0

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

1 <= k <= 10^5

-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4

Difficulty:

Medium

Lock:

Normal
