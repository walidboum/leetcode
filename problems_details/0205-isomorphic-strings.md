## Description

Given two strings

s

and

t

, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in

s

can be replaced to get

t

.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the
        order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map
        to itself.

Example 1:

Input:

s

=

"egg",

t =

"add"

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

s

=

"foo",

t =

"bar"

Output:

false

Example 3:

Input:

s

=

"paper",

t =

"title"

Output:

true

Note:

You may assume both

s

and

t

have the same length.
