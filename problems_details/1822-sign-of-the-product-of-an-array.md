**Companies:** Microsoft

## Description

There is a function

signFunc(x)

that returns:

1

if

x

is positive.

-1

if

x

is negative.

0

if

x

is equal to

0

.

You are given an integer array

nums

. Let

product

be the product of all values in the array

nums

.

Return

signFunc(product)

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

The product of all values in the array is 144, and signFunc(144) = 1

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1,5,0,2,-3]

Output:

0

Explanation:

The product of all values in the array is 0, and signFunc(0) = 0

Example 3:

Input:

nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]

Output:

-1

Explanation:

The product of all values in the array is -1, and signFunc(-1) = -1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000

-100 <= nums[i] <= 100

Difficulty:

Easy

Lock:

Normal

Company:

Microsoft
