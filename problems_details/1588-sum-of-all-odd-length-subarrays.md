## Description

Given an array of positive integers

arr

, calculate the sum of all
            possible odd-length subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguousÂ subsequence of the array.

Return

the sum of all odd-length subarrays of

arr

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [1,4,2,5,3]

Output:

58

Explanation:

The odd-length subarrays of arr and their sums are:
[1] = 1
[4] = 4
[2] = 2
[5] = 5
[3] = 3
[1,4,2] = 7
[4,2,5] = 11
[2,5,3] = 10
[1,4,2,5,3] = 15
If we add all these together we get 1 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 10 + 15 = 58

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,2]

Output:

3

Explanation:

There are only 2 subarrays of odd length, [1] and [2]. Their sum is 3.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [10,11,12]

Output:

66

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 100

1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

Difficulty:

Easy
