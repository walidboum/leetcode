## Description

Implement a magic directory with

buildDict

, and

search

methods.

For the method

buildDict

, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to
        build a dictionary.

For the method

search

, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify

exactly

one character into

another

character in this word, the modified word
        is in the dictionary you just built.

Example 1:

Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False

Note:

You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters

a-z

.

For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly
            efficient algorithm after the contest.

Please remember to

RESET

your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary,
            as static/class variables are

persisted across multiple test cases

. Please see
