## Description

You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.  The billboard
        will have two steel supports, one on each side.  Each steel support must be an equal
        height.

You have a collection of

rods

which can be welded together.  For example,
        if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of
        length 6.

Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation.  If you cannot
        support the billboard, return 0.
