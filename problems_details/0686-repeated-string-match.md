# 686. Repeated String Match

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/686.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/686.html)

**Companies:** Adobe, Amazon, Google

## Description

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B
        is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring
        of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

Note:

The length of

A

and

B

will be between 1 and 10000.
