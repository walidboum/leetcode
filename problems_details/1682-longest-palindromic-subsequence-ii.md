## Description

A subsequence of a string

s

is considered a

good palindromic
            subsequence

if:

It is a subsequence of

s

.

It is a palindrome (has the same value if reversed).

It has an

even

length.

No two consecutive characters are equal, except the two middle ones.

For example, if

s = "abcabcabb"

, then

"abba"

is considered
                a

good palindromic subsequence

, while

"bcb"

(not even
                length) and

"bbbb"

(has equal consecutive characters) are not.

Given a string

s

, return

the

length

of the

longest
                good palindromic subsequence

in

s

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "bbabab"

Output:

4

Explanation:

The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "baab".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "dcbccacdb"

Output:

4

Explanation:

The longest good palindromic subsequence of s is "dccd".

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 250

s

consists of lowercase English letters.

Difficulty:

Medium
