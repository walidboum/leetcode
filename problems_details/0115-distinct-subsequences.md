## Description

Given a string

S

and a string

T

, count the number of
        distinct subsequences of

S

which equals

T

.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by
        deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of
        the remaining characters. (ie,

"ACE"

is a subsequence of

"ABCDE"

while

"AEC"

is not).

Example 1:

S =

"rabbbit"

"rabbit"
