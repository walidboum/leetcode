## Description

Given two strings

text1

and

text2

, return the length of their
        longest common subsequence.

A

subsequence

of a string is a new string generated from the original string with
        some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining
        characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec"
        is not).Â A

common subsequence

of two strings is a subsequence that is
        common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example 1:

Input:

text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"

Output:

3

Explanation:

The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input:

text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"

Output:

3

Explanation:

The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:

Input:

text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"

Output:

0

Explanation:

There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Constraints:

1 <= text1.length <= 1000

1 <= text2.length <= 1000

The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
