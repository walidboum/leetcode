## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you
        beforehand.

(i.e.,

[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]

might become

[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]

).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return

true

,
        otherwise return

false

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2

,5,6,0,0,1,2]

, target = 0

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2

,5,6,0,0,1,2]

, target = 3

Output:

false

Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to

Search
            in Rotated Sorted Array

, where

nums

may contain duplicates.

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
