## Description

Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a
        binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Consider the followingÂ binary search tree:

5
    / \
   2   6
  / \
 1   3

Example 1:

Input:

[5,2,6,1,3]

Output:

false

Example 2:

Input:

[5,2,1,3,6]

Output:

true

Follow up:

Could you do it using only constant space complexity?

Difficulty:

Medium
