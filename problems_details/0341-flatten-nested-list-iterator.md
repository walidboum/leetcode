## Description

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other
        lists.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,1],2,[1,1]]

Output:

[1,1,2,1,1]

Explanation:

By calling

next

repeatedly until

hasNext

returns false,
             the order of elements returned by

next

should be:

[1,1,2,1,1]

.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,[4,[6]]]

Output:

[1,4,6]

Explanation:

By calling

next

repeatedly until

hasNext

returns false,
             the order of elements returned by

next

should be:

[1,4,6]
