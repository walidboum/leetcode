## Description

A

self-dividing number

is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because

128 % 1 == 0

,

128 % 2
        == 0

, and

128 % 8 == 0

.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number,
        including the bounds if possible.

Example 1:

Input:

left = 1, right = 22

Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]

Note:

The boundaries of each input argument are

1 <= left <= right <= 10000

.
