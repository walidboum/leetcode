You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i

2

= -1
        according to the definition.

Example 1:

Input:

"1+1i", "1+1i"

Output:

"0+2i"

Explanation:

(1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i

2

+ 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.

Example 2:

Input:

"1+-1i", "1+-1i"

Output:

"0+-2i"

Explanation:

(1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i

2

- 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.

Note:

The input strings will not have extra blank.

The input strings will be given in the form of

a+bi

, where the integer

a

and

b

will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And

the output should be
                also in this form
