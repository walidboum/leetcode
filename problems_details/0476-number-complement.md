**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/476.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/476.html)

**Companies:** Cloudera

## Description

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip
        the bits of its binary representation.

Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâs binary representation.

Example 1:

Input:

5

Output:

2

Explanation:

The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:

Input:

1

Output:

0

Explanation:

The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
