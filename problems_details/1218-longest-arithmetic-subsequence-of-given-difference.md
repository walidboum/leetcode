## Description

Given an integer array

arr

and an integer

difference

,
        return the length of the longest subsequence in

arr

which
        is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the
        subsequence equals

difference

.

Example 1:

Input:

arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1

Output:

4

Explanation:

The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].

Example 2:

Input:

arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.

Example 3:

Input:

arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2

Output:

4

Explanation:

The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4

Difficulty:

Medium

Lock:

Normal
