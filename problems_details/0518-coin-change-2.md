## Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function
        to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have
        infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1:

Input:

amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]

Output:

4

Explanation:

there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

Example 2:

Input:

amount = 3, coins = [2]

Output:

0

Explanation:

the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

Example 3:

Input:

amount = 10, coins = [10]

Output:

1

Note:

You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000

1 <= coin <= 5000

the number of coins is less than 500

the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
