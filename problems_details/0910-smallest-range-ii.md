## Description

Given an array

A

of integers, for each integer

A[i]

we need to
        choose

either

x = -K

or

x = K

, and add

x

to

A[i]

(only once)

.

After this process, we have some array

B

.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of

B

and
        the minimum value of

B

.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

[1]

, K =

0

Output:

0

Explanation

: B = [1]

Example 2:

Input:

A =

[0,10]

, K =

2

Output:

6

Explanation

: B = [2,8]

Example 3:

Input:

A =

[1,3,6]

, K =

3

Output:

3

Explanation

: B = [4,6,3]

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000

0 <= A[i] <= 10000
