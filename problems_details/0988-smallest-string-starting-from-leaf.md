**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given the

root

of a binary tree, each node has a value from

0

to

25

representing the letters

'a'

to

'z'

: a value of

0

represents

'a'

, a
        value of

1

represents

'b'

, and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the
        root.

(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example,

"ab"

is lexicographically smaller than

"aba"

. 
        A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)
