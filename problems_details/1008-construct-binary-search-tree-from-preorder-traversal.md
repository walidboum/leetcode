**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1008.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1008.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Facebook, Oracle

## Description

Return the root node of a binary

search

tree that matches the given

preorder

traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every

node

, any descendant of

node.left

has a value

<

node.val

, and any descendant of

node.right

has a value

>

node.val

.  Also recall that a preorder
        traversal displays the value of the

node

first, then traverses

node.left

,
        then traverses

node.right

.)

Example 1:

Input:

[8,5,1,7,10,12]

Output:

[8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

Note:

1 <= preorder.length <= 100

The values of

preorder

are distinct.

Difficulty:
