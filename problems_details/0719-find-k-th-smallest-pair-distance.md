## Description

Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest

distance

among all the pairs. The
        distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,3,1]
k = 1

Output: 0

Explanation:

Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.

Note:

2 <= len(nums) <= 10000

.

0 <= nums[i] < 1000000

.

1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2

.
