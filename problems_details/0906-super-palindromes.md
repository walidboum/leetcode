## Description

Let's say a positive integer is a

superpalindrome

if it is a
        palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.

Now, given two positive integers

L

and

R

(represented as
        strings), return the number of superpalindromes in the inclusive range

[L, R]

.

Example 1:

Input:

L =

"4"

, R =

"1000"

Output:

4

Explanation

:

4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.

Note:

1 <= len(L) <= 18

1 <= len(R) <= 18

L

and

R

are strings representing integers in the range

[1,
            10^18)

.

int(L) <= int(R)
