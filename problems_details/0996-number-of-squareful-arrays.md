## Description

Given an array

A

of non-negative integers, the array is

squareful

if
        for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.Â  Two permutations

A1

and

A2

differ if and only if there is some index

i

such that

A1[i] != A2[i]

.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,17,8]

Output:

2

Explanation:

[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.

Example 2:

Input:

[2,2,2]

Output:

1

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 12

0 <= A[i] <= 1e9
