## Description

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree
        along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to
        child (cannot be the reverse).

Example 1:

Input:

1
    \
     3
    / \
   2   4
        \
         5

Output:

3

Explanation:

Longest consecutive sequence path is

3-4-5

, so return

3

.

Example 2:

Input:

2
    \
     3
    /
   2
  /
 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

Longest consecutive sequence path is

2-3

, not

3-2-1

, so return

2

.
