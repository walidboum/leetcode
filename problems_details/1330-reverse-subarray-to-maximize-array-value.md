**Companies:** Codenation

## Description

You are given an integer array

nums

. The

value

of this array
            is defined as the sum of

|nums[i]-nums[i+1]|

for all

0 <=
                i < nums.length-1

.

You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. You can
                perform this operation

only once

.

Find maximum possible value of the final array.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [2,3,1,5,4]

Output:

10

Explanation:

By reversing the subarray [3,1,5] the array becomes [2,5,1,3,4] whose value is 10.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2,4,9,24,2,1,10]

Output:

68

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3*10^4

-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
