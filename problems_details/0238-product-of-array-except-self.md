## Description

Given an array

nums

of

n

integers where

n

> 1, Â return
        an array

output

such that

output[i]

is equal to the product of all
        the elements of

nums

except

nums[i]

.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[1,2,3,4]
Output:
[24,12,8,6]
Note:
Please solve it
without division
and in O(
n
).
Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array
does
            not
count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
```
