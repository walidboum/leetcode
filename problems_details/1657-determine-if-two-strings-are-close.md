## Description

Two strings are considered

close

if you can attain one from the
            other using the following operations:

Operation 1: Swap any two

existing

characters.

For example,

a

b

cd

e

-> a

e

cd

b

Operation 2: Transform

every

occurrence of one

existing

character into another

existing

character, and do the same with the other character.

For example,

aa

c

abb

->

bb

c

baa

(all

a

's turn into

b

's, and all

b

's turn into

a

's)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings,

word1

and

word2

, return

true

if

word1

and

word2

are

close

, and

false

otherwise.

Example 1:

Input:

word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"

Output:

true

Explanation:

You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "a

bc

" -> "a

cb

"
Apply Operation 1: "

a

c

b

" -> "

b

c

a

"

Example 2:

Input:

word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"

Output:

false

Explanation:

It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.

Example 3:

Input:

word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"

Output:

true

Explanation:

You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "ca

b

bb

a

" -> "ca

a

bb

b

"

Apply Operation 2: "

c

aa

bbb

" -> "

b

aa

ccc

"
Apply Operation 2: "

baa

ccc" -> "

abb

ccc"

Example 4:

Input:

word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "aabbss"

Output:

false

Explanation:

It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any amount of operations.

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10

5

word1

and

word2

containÂ only lowercase English
                    letters.
