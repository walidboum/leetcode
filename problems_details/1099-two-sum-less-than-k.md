## Description

Given an array

A

of integers and integer

K

, return the maximum

S

such that there exists

i < j

with

A[i] + A[j] =
            S

and

S < K

. If no

i, j

exist satisfying this
        equation, return -1.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

[34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8]

, K =

60

Output:

58

Explanation:

We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.

Example 2:

Input:

A =

[10,20,30]

, K =

15

Output:

-1

Explanation:

In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 100

1 <= A[i] <= 1000

1 <= K <= 2000
