## Description

Given

n

points

on a 2D plane where

points[i] =
            [x

i

, y

i

]

, Return

the

widest vertical
            area

between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A

vertical area

is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along
                the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The

widest vertical area

is the
                one with the maximum width.

Note that points

on the edge

of a vertical area

are
                not

considered included in the area.

Example 1:

â

Input:

points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]

Output:

1

Explanation:

Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

Example 2:

Input:

points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]

Output:

3

Constraints:

n == points.length

2 <= n <= 10

5

points[i].length == 2

0 <= x

i

, y

i

<= 10
