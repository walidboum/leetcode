Given an integer

n

, return

the number of strings of
            length

n

that consist only of vowels
            (

a

,

e

,

i

,

o

,

u

)
            and are

lexicographically sorted

.

A string

s

is

lexicographically sorted

if for all valid

i

,

s[i]

is the same as or comes before

s[i+1]

in the alphabet.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 1

Output:

5

Explanation:

Output:

66045

Constraints:
