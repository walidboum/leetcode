## Description

Given a

m

x

n

matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to
        0. Do it

in-place

.

Example 1:

Input:

[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]

Output:

[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]

Example 2:

Input:

[
  [0,1,2,0],
  [3,4,5,2],
  [1,3,1,5]
]

Output:

[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [0,4,5,0],
  [0,3,1,0]
]

Follow up:

A straight forward solution using O(

m

n

) space is probably a bad idea.

A simple improvement uses O(

m

+

n

) space, but still not the best
            solution.

Could you devise a constant space solution?
