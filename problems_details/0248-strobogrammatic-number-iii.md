## Description

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at
        upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low
        <= num <= high.

## Examples

### Example

Example:
Input:
low = "50", high = "100"
Output:
3
Explanation:
69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.

        represented as string.
