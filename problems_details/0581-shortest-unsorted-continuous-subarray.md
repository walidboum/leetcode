## Description

Given an integer array, you need to find one

continuous subarray

that if you only sort
        this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array will be sorted in ascending order,
        too.

You need to find the

shortest

such subarray and output its length.

Example 1:

Input:

[2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]

Output:

5

Explanation:

You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array sorted in ascending order.

Note:

The input array may contain duplicates, so ascending order here means

<=

.
