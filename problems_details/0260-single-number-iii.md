## Description

Given an array of numbers

nums

, in which exactly two elements appear only once
        and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only
        once.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output:
[3,5]
Note
:
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example,
[5, 3]
is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using
            only constant space complexity?
```
