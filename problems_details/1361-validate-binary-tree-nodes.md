## Description

You have

n

binary tree nodesÂ numbered from

0

to

n - 1

where node

i

has two children

leftChild[i]

and

rightChild[i]

,
            return

true

if and only if

all

the given nodes
            form

exactly one

valid binary tree.

If node

i

has no left child
                then

leftChild[i]

will equal

-1

, similarly
                for the right child.

Note that the nodes have no values and that we only use the node numbers in this
                problem.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,-1]

Output:

true

Example 2:

Input:

n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,3,-1,-1]

Output:

false

Example 3:

Input:

n = 2, leftChild = [1,0], rightChild = [-1,-1]

Output:

false

Example 4:

Input:

n = 6, leftChild = [1,-1,-1,4,-1,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,5,-1,-1]

Output:

false

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4

leftChild.length == rightChild.length == n

-1 <= leftChild[i], rightChild[i] <= n - 1

Difficulty:

Medium
