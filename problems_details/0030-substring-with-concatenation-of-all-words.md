## Description

You are given a string,

s

words

, that
        are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in

that is a concatenation of each word in

words

exactly once and without any
        intervening characters.

Example 1:

Input:
  s =

"barfoothefoobarman",

words =

["foo","bar"]
