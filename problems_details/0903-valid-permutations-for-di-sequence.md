**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/903.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/903.html)

**Companies:** Unknown

## Description

We are given

S

, a length

n

string of characters from the set

{'D',
        'I'}

. (These letters stand for "decreasing" and "increasing".)

A

valid permutation

is a permutation

P[0], P[1], ..., P[n]

of
        integers

{0, 1, ..., n}

, such that for all

i

:

If

S[i] == 'D'

, then

P[i] > P[i+1]

, and;

If

S[i] == 'I'

, then

P[i] < P[i+1]

.

How many valid permutations are there?Â  Since the answer may be large,

return
        your answer modulo

10^9 + 7

.

Example 1:

Input:

"DID"

Output:

5

Explanation:

The 5 valid permutations of (0, 1, 2, 3) are:
(1, 0, 3, 2)
(2, 0, 3, 1)
(2, 1, 3, 0)
(3, 0, 2, 1)
(3, 1, 2, 0)

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200

S

consists only of characters from the set

{'D',
            'I'}

.
