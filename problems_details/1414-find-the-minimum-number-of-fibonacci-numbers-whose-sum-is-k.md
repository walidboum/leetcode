## Description

Given the number

k

,

return the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers
            whose sum is equal to

k

, whether a Fibonacci number could be used
            multiple times.

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

F

1

= 1

F

2

= 1

F

n

= F

n-1

+ F

n-2

, for n > 2.

It is guaranteed that for the given constraints we can always find such fibonacci
            numbers that sum

k

.

Example 1:

Input:

k = 7

Output:

2

Explanation:

The Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
For k = 7 we can use 2 + 5 = 7.

Example 2:

Input:

k = 10

Output:

2

Explanation:

For k = 10 we can use 2 + 8 = 10.

Example 3:

Input:

k = 19

Output:

3

Explanation:

For k = 19 we can use 1 + 5 + 13 = 19.

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 10^9

Difficulty:

Medium

Lock:

Normal
