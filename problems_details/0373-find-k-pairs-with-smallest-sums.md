## Description

You are given two integer arrays

nums1

and

nums2

sorted in ascending order and
        an integer

k

.

Define a pair

(u,v)

which consists of one element from the first array and one element
        from the second array.

Find the k pairs

(u

1

,v

1

),(u

2

,v

2

)
        ...(u

k

,v

k

)

with the smallest sums.

Example 1:

Input:

nums1 =

[1,7,11]

, nums2 =

[2,4,6]

, k =

3

Output:

[[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]

Explanation:

The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence:
             [1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]

Example 2:

Input:

nums1 = [1,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3], k = 2

Output:

[1,1],[1,1]

Explanation:

The first 2 pairs are returned from the sequence:
             [1,1],[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2],[1,3],[1,3],[2,3]

Example 3:

Input:

nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3], k = 3

Output:

[1,3],[2,3]

Explanation:

All possible pairs are returned from the sequence: [1,3],[2,3]
