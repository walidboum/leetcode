## Description

A message containing letters from

A-Z

is being encoded to numbers using the
        following mapping way:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26

Beyond that, now the encoded string can also contain the character '*', which can be treated
        as one of the numbers from 1 to 9.

Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*', return the total number
        of ways to decode it.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 10

9

+
        7.

Example 1:

Input:

"*"

Output:

9

Explanation:

The encoded message can be decoded to the string: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I".

Example 2:

Input:

"1*"

Output:

9 + 9 = 18

Note:

The length of the input string will fit in range [1, 10

5

].

The input string will only contain the character '*' and digits '0' - '9'.
