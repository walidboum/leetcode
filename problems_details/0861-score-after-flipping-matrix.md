**Companies:** IIT Bombay

## Description

We have a two dimensional matrix

A

where each value is

0

or

1

.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column:
        changing all

0

s to

1

s, and all

1

s to

0

s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number,
        and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possibleÂ score.

Example 1:

Input:

[[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]

Output:

39

Explanation:

Toggled to

[[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 20

1 <= A[0].length <= 20

A[i][j]

is

0

or

1

.

Difficulty:

Medium

Lock:
