## Description

Given an array of prices

[p

1

,p

2

...,p

n

]

and a

target

, round each price

p

i

to

Round

i

(p

i

)

so that the rounded array

[Round

1

(p

1

),Round

2

(p

2

)...,Round

n

(p

n

)]

sums to the given

target

. Each operation

Round

i

(p

i

)

could be either

Floor(p

i

)

or

Ceil(p

i

)

.

Return the string

"-1"

if the rounded array is impossible to sum to

target

. Otherwise, return the smallest rounding error, which is defined as
        Î£ |Round

i

(p

i

) - (p

i

)| for

i

from 1 to

n

, as a string with three places after the decimal.

Example 1:

Input:

prices =

["0.700","2.800","4.900"]

, target =

8

Output:

"1.000"

Explanation:

Use Floor, Ceil and Ceil operations to get (0.7 - 0) + (3 - 2.8) + (5 - 4.9) = 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0 .

Example 2:

Input:

prices =

["1.500","2.500","3.500"]

, target =

10

Output:

"-1"

Explanation:

It is impossible to meet the target.

Note:

1 <= prices.length <= 500

.

Each string of prices

prices[i]

represents a real number which is between 0
            and 1000 and has exactly 3 decimal places.

target

is between 0 and 1000000.
