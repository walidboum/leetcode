## Description

Given two strings

str1

and

str2

of the same length, determine
        whether you can transform

str1

into

str2

by doing

zero
            or more

conversions

.

In one conversion you can convert

all

occurrences of one character in

str1

to

any

other lowercase English character.

Return

true

if and only if you can transform

str1

into

str2

.

Example 1:

Input:

str1 =

"aabcc"

, str2 =

"ccdee"

Output:

true

Explanation:

Convert 'c' to 'e' then 'b' to 'd' then 'a' to 'c'. Note that the order of conversions matter.

Example 2:

Input:

str1 =

"leetcode"

, str2 =

"codeleet"

Output:

false

Explanation:

There is no way to transform str1 to str2.

Note:

1 <= str1.length == str2.length <= 10^4

Both

and

str2

contain only lowercase English letters.
