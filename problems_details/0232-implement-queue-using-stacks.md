## Description

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.

pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.

peek() -- Get the front element.

empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
Notes:
You must use
only
standard operations of a stack -- which means only
push
            to top
,
peek/pop from top
,
size
, and
is
            empty
operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a
            stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard
            operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations
            will be called on an empty queue).
