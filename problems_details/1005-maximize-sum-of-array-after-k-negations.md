## Description

Given an array

A

of integers, we

must

modify the array in
        the following way: we choose an

i

and replace

A[i]

with

-A[i]

, and we repeat this process

K

times in total.Â  (We may
        choose the same index

i

multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

Example 1:

Input:

A =

[4,2,3]

, K =

1

Output:

5

Explanation:

Choose indices (1,) and A becomes [4,-2,3].

Example 2:

Input:

A =

[3,-1,0,2]

, K =

3

Output:

6

Explanation:

Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and A becomes [3,1,0,2].

Example 3:

Input:

A =

[2,-3,-1,5,-4]

, K =

2

Output:

13

Explanation:

Choose indices (1, 4) and A becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].
