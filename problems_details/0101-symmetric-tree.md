## Description

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its
        center).

For example, this binary tree

[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]

is symmetric:

1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

But the following

[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]

is not:

1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

Note:

Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
