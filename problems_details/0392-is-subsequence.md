## Description

Given a string

s

and a string

t

, check if

s

is subsequence of

t

.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both

s

and

t

.

t

is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and

s

is a short
        string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by
        deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of
        the remaining characters. (ie,

"ace"

is a subsequence of

"abcde"

while

"aec"

is not).

Example 1:

s

=

"abc"

,

t

=

"ahbgdc"

Return

true

.

Example 2:

s

=

"axc"

,

t

=

"ahbgdc"

Return

false

.

Follow up:

If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check
        one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your
        code?
