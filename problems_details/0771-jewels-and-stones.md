## Description

You're given strings

J

representing the types of stones that are jewels, and

S

representing the stones you have.  Each character in

S

is a
        type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also
        jewels.

The letters in

J

are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in

J

and

"A"

.

Input:

J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"

Output:

3

J = "z", S = "ZZ"
