## Description

Given a

non-empty

integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all
        array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a
        selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[1,2,3]
Output:
2
Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
```
