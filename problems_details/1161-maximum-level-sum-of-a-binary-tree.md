**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1161.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1161.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Google

## Description

Given the

root

of a binary tree, the level of its root is

1

, the
        level of its children is

2

, and so on.

Return the

smallest

level

X

such that the sum of all the values
        of nodes at level

X

is

maximal

.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]

Output:

2

Explanation:

Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree is between

1

and

10^4

.

-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5

Difficulty:

Medium
