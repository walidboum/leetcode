## Description

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the
        tree.

According to the

definition of LCA on Wikipedia

: “The lowest
        common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that
        has both p and q as descendants (where we allow

a node to be a descendant of
            itself

).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

Example 1:

Input:

root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

Output:

3

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes

5

and

1

is

3.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

Output:

5

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes

5

and

4

is

5

, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.

p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
