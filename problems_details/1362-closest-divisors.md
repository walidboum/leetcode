## Description

Given an integer

num

, find the closest two integers in absolute
            difference whose product equals

num + 1

or

num + 2

.

Return the two integers in any order.

Example 1:

Input:

num = 8

Output:

[3,3]

Explanation:

For num + 1 = 9, the closest divisors are 3 & 3, for num + 2 = 10, the closest divisors are 2 & 5, hence 3 & 3 is chosen.

Example 2:

Input:

num = 123

Output:

[5,25]

Example 3:

Input:

num = 999

Output:

[40,25]

Constraints:
