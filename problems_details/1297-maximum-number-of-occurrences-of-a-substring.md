## Description

Given a string

s

, return the maximum number of ocurrences of

any

substringÂ under the following rules:

The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to

maxLetters

.

The substring size must be between

minSize

and

maxSize

inclusive.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4

Output:

2

Explanation:

Substring "aab" has 2 ocurrences in the original string.
It satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize).

Example 2:

s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3

Output:

2

Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.

Example 3:

Input:

s = "aabcabcab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 2, maxSize = 3

Output:

3

Example 4:

Input:

s = "abcde", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3

Output:

0

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5

1 <= maxLetters <= 26

1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)

s

only contains lowercase English letters.
