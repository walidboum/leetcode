## Description

Given a binary array

data

, return the minimum number of swaps required
        to group all

1

’s present in the array together in

any
            place

in the array.

Example 1:

Input:

[1,0,1,0,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.

Example 2:

Input:

[0,0,0,1,0]

Output:

0

Explanation:

Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.

Example 3:

Input:

[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]

Output:

3

Explanation:

One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
