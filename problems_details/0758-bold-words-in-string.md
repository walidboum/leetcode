**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/758.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/758.html)

**Companies:** Google

## Description

Given a set of keywords

words

and a string

S

, make all appearances
        of all keywords in

S

bold. Any letters between

<b>

and

</b>

tags become bold.

The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of course the tags
        should form a valid combination.

For example, given that

words = ["ab", "bc"]

and

S = "aabcd"

, we
        should return

"a<b>abc</b>d"

. Note that returning

"a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d"

would use more tags, so it is incorrect.

Note:

words

has length in range

[0, 50]

.

words[i]

has length in range

[1, 10]

.

S

has length in range

[0, 500]

.

All characters in

words[i]

and

S

are lowercase letters.
