## Description

You are given a string

num

, representing a large integer, and an integer

k

.

We call some integer

wonderful

if it is a

permutation

of the digits in

num

and is

greater in value

than

num

. There can be many wonderful integers. However, we only care about the

smallest-valued

ones.

For example, when

num = "5489355142"

:

The 1

st

smallest wonderful integer is

"5489355214"

.

The 2

nd

smallest wonderful integer is

"5489355241"

.

The 3

rd

smallest wonderful integer is

"5489355412"

.

The 4

th

smallest wonderful integer is

"5489355421"

.

Return

the

minimum number of adjacent digit swaps

that needs to be applied to

num

to reach the

k

th

smallest wonderful

integer

.

The tests are generated in such a way that

k

th

smallest wonderful integer exists.

Example 1:

Input:

num = "5489355142", k = 4

Output:

2

Explanation:

The 4

th

smallest wonderful number is "5489355421". To get this number:
- Swap index 7 with index 8: "5489355

14

2" -> "5489355

41

2"
- Swap index 8 with index 9: "54893554

12

" -> "54893554

21

"

Example 2:

Input:

num = "11112", k = 4

Output:

4

Explanation:

The 4

th

smallest wonderful number is "21111". To get this number:
- Swap index 3 with index 4: "111

12

" -> "111

21

"
- Swap index 2 with index 3: "11

12

1" -> "11

21

1"
- Swap index 1 with index 2: "1

12

11" -> "1

21

11"
- Swap index 0 with index 1: "

12

111" -> "

21

111"

Example 3:

Input:

num = "00123", k = 1

Output:

1

Explanation:

The 1

st

smallest wonderful number is "00132". To get this number:
- Swap index 3 with index 4: "001

23

" -> "001

32

"

Constraints:

2 <= num.length <= 1000

1 <= k <= 1000

num

only consists of digits.
