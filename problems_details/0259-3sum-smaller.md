## Description

Given an array of

n

integers

nums

and a

target

, find the number of index
        triplets

i, j, k

with

0 <= i < j < k < n

that satisfy
        the condition

nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target

.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
nums
=
[-2,0,1,3]
, and
target
= 2
Output:
2
Explanation:
Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
Â             [-2,0,1]
             [-2,0,3]
Follow up:
Could you solve it in
O
(
n
2
) runtime?
