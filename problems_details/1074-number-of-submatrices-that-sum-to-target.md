## Description

Given a

matrix

, and a

target

, return the number of non-empty
        submatrices that sum to

target

.

A submatrix

x1, y1, x2, y2

is the set of all cells

matrix[x][y]

with

x1 <= x <= x2

and

y1 <= y <= y2

.

Two submatrices

(x1, y1, x2, y2)

and

(x1', y1', x2',
        y2')

are different if they have some coordinateÂ that is different: for
        example, if

x1 != x1'

.

Example 1:

Input:

matrix =

[[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]]

, target =

0

Output:

4

Explanation:

The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.

Example 2:

Input:

matrix =

[[1,-1],[-1,1]]

, target =

0

Output:

5

Explanation:

The two 1x2 submatrices, plus the two 2x1 submatrices, plus the 2x2 submatrix.
