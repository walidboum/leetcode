## Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
        so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network
        connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a

binary search tree

. There is no
        restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need
        to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be
        deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note:

Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize
        and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
