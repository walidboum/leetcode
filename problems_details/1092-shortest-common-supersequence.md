## Description

Given two strings

str1

and

str2

, return the shortest string
        that has both

str1

and

str2

as subsequences.  If
        multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T
        (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen

anywhere

from T) results in the string S.)

Example 1:

Input:

str1 =

"abac"

, str2 =

"cab"

Output:

"cabac"

Explanation:

str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.

Note:

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000

str1

and

str2

consist of lowercase English letters.
