## Description

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their
        depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other
        lists.

Different from the

previous
        question

where weight is increasing from root to leaf, now the weight is defined from
        bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the
        largest weight.

Example 1:

Input:

[[1,1],2,[1,1]]

Output:

8

Explanation:

F

our 1's at depth 1, one 2 at depth 2.

Example 2:

Input:

[1,[4,[6]]]

Output:

17

Explanation:

O

ne 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1; 1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17.
