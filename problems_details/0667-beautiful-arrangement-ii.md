## Description

Given two integers

n

and

k

, you need to construct a list which
        contains

n

different positive integers ranging from

1

to

n

and obeys the following requirement:

Suppose this list is [a

1

, a

2

, a

3

, ... , a

n

],
        then the list [|a

1

- a

2

|, |a

2

- a

3

|,
        |a

3

- a

4

|, ... , |a

n-1

- a

n

|] has exactly

k

distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example 1:

Input:

n = 3, k = 1

Output:

[1, 2, 3]

Explanation:

The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.

Example 2:

Input:

n = 3, k = 2

Output:

[1, 3, 2]

Explanation:

The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.

Note:

The

n

and

k

are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 10

4

.
