## Description

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example:
        "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated
        sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than
        once in a DNA molecule.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output:
["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
```
