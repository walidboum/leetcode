## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys

less than

the
            node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys

greater than

the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

2
   / \
  1   3

Input:

[2,1,3]

Output:

true

Example 2:

5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input:

[5,1,4,null,null,3,6]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
