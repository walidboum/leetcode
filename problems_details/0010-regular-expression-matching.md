## Description

Given an input string (

s

) and a pattern (

p

), implement regular
        expression matching with support for

'.'

and

'*'

.

'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the

entire

input string (not partial).

Note:

s

could be empty and contains only lowercase letters

a-z

.

p

could be empty and contains only lowercase letters

a-z

, and
            characters like

.

or

*

.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "aa"
p = "a"

Output:

false

Explanation:

"a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:

Input:

s = "aa"
p = "a*"

Output:

true

Explanation:

'*' means zero or more of the precedingÂ element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

Example 3:

Input:

s = "ab"
p = ".*"

Output:

true

Explanation:

".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

Example 4:

Input:

s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"

Output:

true

Explanation:

c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".

Example 5:

Input:

s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."

Output:

false
