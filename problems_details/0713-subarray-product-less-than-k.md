k

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100

Output:

8

Explanation:

The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

Note:

0 < nums.length <= 50000

.

0 < nums[i] < 1000

.

0 <= k < 10^6
