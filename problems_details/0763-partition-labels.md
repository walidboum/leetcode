## Description

A string

S

of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into
        as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list
        of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:

Input:

S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"

Output:

[9,7,8]

Explanation:

The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

Note:

S

will have length in range

[1, 500]

.

S

will consist of lowercase letters (

'a'

to

'z'

)
            only.
