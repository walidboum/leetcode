## Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
        so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network
        connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted
        tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your
        serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary
        tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree
        structure.

For example, you may serialize the following

3-ary

tree

as

[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]

. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so
        please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note:

N

is in the range of

[1, 1000]

Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and
            deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
