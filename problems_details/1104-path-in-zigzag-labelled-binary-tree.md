**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1104.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1104.html)

**Companies:** Amazon, Bloomberg, Microsoft

## Description

In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row
        order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right,
        while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to
        left.

Given the

label

of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the
        root of the tree to theÂ node with that

label

.

Example 1:

Input:

label = 14

Output:

[1,3,4,14]

Example 2:

Input:

label = 26

Output:

[1,2,6,10,26]

Constraints:

1 <= label <= 10^6

Difficulty:

Medium

Lock:

Normal

Company:
