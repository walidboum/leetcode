## Description

Given a non-empty 2D array

grid

of 0's and 1's, an

island

is a
        group of

1

's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or
        vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum
        area is 0.)

Example 1:

[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,

 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]

Given the above grid, return

6

. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must
    be connected 4-directionally.

Example 2:

[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Given the above grid, return

0

.

Note:

The length of each dimension in the given

grid

does not exceed 50.
