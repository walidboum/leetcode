## Description

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is:

k[encoded_string]

, where the

encoded_string

inside
        the square brackets is being repeated exactly

k

times. Note that

k

is
        guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets
        are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that
        digits are only for those repeat numbers,

k

. For example, there won't be input
        like

3a

or

2[4]

.

Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
