## Description

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return

null

.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer

pos

which
        represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects to. If

pos

is

-1

, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note:

Do not modify the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:

head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1

Output:

tail connects to node index 1

Explanation:

There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Example 2:

Input:

head = [1,2], pos = 0

Output:

tail connects to node index 0

Explanation:

There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Example 3:

Input:

head = [1], pos = -1

Output:

no cycle
