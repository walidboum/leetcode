## Description

Given a

m * n

matrix of ones and zeros, return how many

square

submatrices have all ones.

Example 1:

Input:

matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]

Output:

15

Explanation:

There are

10

  [1,1,0]
]

Output:

7

Explanation:

There are

6

squares of side 1.
There is

1

square of side 2.
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 =

7

.
