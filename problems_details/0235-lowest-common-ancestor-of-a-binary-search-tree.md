## Description

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in
        the BST.

According to the

definition of LCA on Wikipedia

: “The lowest
        common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has
        both p and q as descendants (where we allow

a node to be a descendant of itself

).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

Example 1:

Input:

root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8

Output:

6

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes

2

and

8

is

6

.

Example 2:

Input:

root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4

Output:

2

Explanation:

The LCA of nodes

2

and

4

is

2

, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.

p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
