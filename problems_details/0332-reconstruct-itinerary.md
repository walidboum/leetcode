## Description

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports

[from,
        to]

, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who
        departs from

JFK

. Thus, the itinerary must begin with

JFK

.

Note:

If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the
            smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary

["JFK",
                "LGA"]

has a smaller lexical order than

["JFK",
                "LGB"]

.

All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

Example 1:

Input:

[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]

Output:

["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]

Example 2:

Input:

[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]

Output:

["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]

Explanation:

Another possible reconstruction is

["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]

.
Â             But it is larger in lexical order.
