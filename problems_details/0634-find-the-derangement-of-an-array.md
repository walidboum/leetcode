**Companies:** Amazon, IXL

## Description

In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such
        that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of

n

integers from 1 to

n

in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 10

9

+
        7.

Example 1:

Input:

3

Output:

2

Explanation:

The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].

Note:

n

is in the range of [1, 10

6

].
