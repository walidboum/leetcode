## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest

continuous

increasing subsequence (subarray).

Example 1:

Input:

[1,3,5,4,7]

Output:

3

Explanation:

The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.

Example 2:

Input:

[2,2,2,2,2]

Output:

1

Explanation:

The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.

Note:

Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
