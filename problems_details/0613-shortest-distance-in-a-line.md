## Description

Table

point

holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are
    all integers.

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'.
    So the output is as below:

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |

Note:

Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table

point

.

Follow-up:

What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the
    right most of x axis?
