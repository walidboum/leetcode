# 431. Encode N-ary Tree to Binary Tree

## Description

Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to
        get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more
        than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more
        than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work.
        You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary
        tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.

For example, you may encode the following

3-ary

tree to a binary tree in this
        way:

Note that the above is just an example which

might or might not

work. You do not
        necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different
        approaches yourself.

Note:

N

is in the range of

[1, 1000]

Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode
            algorithms should be stateless.
