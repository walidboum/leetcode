## Description

Consider the string

s

to be the infinite wraparound string of
        "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so

Now we have another string

p

. Your job is to find out how many unique non-empty
        substrings of

p

are present in

s

. In particular, your input is the
        string

p

and you need to output the number of different non-empty substrings of

p

in the string

s

p

consists of only lowercase English letters and the size of p
        might be over 10000.
