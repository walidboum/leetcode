## Description

A decimal number is called

deci-binary

if each of its digits is
            either

0

or

1

without any leading zeros. For example,

101

and

1100

are

deci-binary

, while

112

and

3001

are not.

Given a string

n

that represents a positive decimal integer, return

the

minimum

number of positive

deci-binary

numbers
                needed so that they sum up to

n

.

Example 1:

Input:

n = "32"

Output:

3

Explanation:

10 + 11 + 11 = 32

Example 2:

Input:

n = "82734"

Output:

8

Example 3:

Input:

n = "27346209830709182346"

Output:

9

Constraints:

1 <= n.length <= 10

5

n

consists of only digits.

n

does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive
                    integer.
