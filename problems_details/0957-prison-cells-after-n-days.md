## Description

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following
        rules:

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then
            the cell becomes occupied.

Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't
        have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way:

cells[i] ==
        1

if the

i

-th cell is occupied, else

cells[i] == 0

.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after

N

days (and

N

such changes described above.)
