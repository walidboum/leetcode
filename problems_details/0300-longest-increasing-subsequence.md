## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

## Examples

### Example

```
Example:
Input:
[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output:
4
Explanation:
The longest increasing subsequence is
[2,3,7,101]
, therefore the length is
4
.
Note:
There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the
            length.
Your algorithm should run in O(
n
2
) complexity.
Follow up:
Could you improve it to O(
n
log
n
) time complexity?
