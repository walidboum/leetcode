## Description

Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the
        current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all
        valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

Example 1:

Input:

"19:34"

Output:

"19:39"

Output:

"22:22"

Explanation:

The next closest time choosing from digits
