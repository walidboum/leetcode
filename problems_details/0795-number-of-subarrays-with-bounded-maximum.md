## Description

We are given an array

A

of positive integers, and two positive integers

L

and

R

(

L <= R

).

Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum
        array element in that subarray is at least

L

and at most

R

.

Example :

Input:

A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
L = 2
R = 3

Output:

3

Explanation:

There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].

Note:

L, R  and

A[i]

will be an integer in the range

[0, 10^9]

.

The length of
