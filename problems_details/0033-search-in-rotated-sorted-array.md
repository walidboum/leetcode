## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you
        beforehand.

(i.e.,

[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]

might become

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise
        return

-1

.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of

O

(log

n

).

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [

4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

, target = 0

Output:

4

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [

4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

, target = 3

Output:

-1
