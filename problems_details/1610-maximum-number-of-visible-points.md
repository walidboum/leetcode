# 1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points

**Source:** [https://leetcode.ca/all/1610.html](https://leetcode.ca/all/1610.html)

**Companies:** Nvidia

## Description

You are given an array

points

, an integer

angle

, and your

location

, where

location = [pos

x

, pos

y

]

and

points[i] = [x

i

, y

i

]

both denote

integral
                coordinates

on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You

cannot
                move

from your position, but you can

rotate

. In other
                words,

pos

x

and

pos

y

cannot be
                changed. Your field of view in

degrees

is represented by

angle

,
                determiningÂ how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let

d

be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your
                field of view is the

inclusive

range of angles

[d - angle/2,
                    d + angle/2]

.

You can

see

some set of points if, for each point, the

angle

formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east
                direction from your position is

in your field of view

.

There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location,
                and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not
                obstruct your vision to other points.

Return

the maximum number of points you can see

.

Example 1:

Input:

points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]

Output:

3

Explanation:

The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is in front and in the same line of sight.

Example 2:

Input:

points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]

Output:

4

Explanation:

All points can be made visible in your field of view, including the one at your location.

Example 3:

Input:

points = [[1,0],[2,1]], angle = 13, location = [1,1]

Output:

1

Explanation:

You can only see one of the two points, as shown above.

Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 10

5

points[i].length == 2

location.length == 2

0 <= angle < 360

0 <= pos
