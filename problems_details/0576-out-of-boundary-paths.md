## Description

There is an

m

by

n

grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate

(i,j)

of
        the ball, you can move the ball to

adjacent

cell or cross the grid boundary in four
        directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can

at most

move

N

times.
        Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very
        large, return it after mod 10

9

+ 7.

Example 1:

Input:

m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0

Output:

6

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input:

m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1

Output:

12

Explanation:

Note:

Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.

The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].

N is in range [0,50].
