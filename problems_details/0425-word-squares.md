## Description

Given a set of words

(without duplicates)

, find all

word squares

you
        can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the

k

th

row and column
        read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤

k

< max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence

["ball","area","lead","lady"]

forms a word square
        because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y

Note:

There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.

All words will have the exact same length.

Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.

Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet

a-z

.

Example 1:

Input:

["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

Output:

    "lead",
    "lady"
  ],
  [ "ball",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ]
]

Explanation:

The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

Example 2:

Input:

["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

Output:

[
  [ "baba",
    "abat",
    "baba",
    "atan"
  ],

Explanation:

The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
