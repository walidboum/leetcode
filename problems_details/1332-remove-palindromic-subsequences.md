## Description

Given a string

s

consisting only of letters

'a'

and

'b'

. In a single step you can remove one palindromic

subsequence

from

s

.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some
                characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as
                forward.

Example 1:

Input:

s = "ababa"

Output:

1

Explanation:

String is already palindrome

Example 2:

Input:

s = "abb"

Output:

2

Explanation:

"

a

bb" -> "

bb

" -> "".
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".

Example 3:

Input:

s = "baabb"

Output:

2

Explanation:

"

baa

b

b

" -> "b" -> "".
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".

Example 4:

Input:

s = ""

Output:

0

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000

s

only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'

Difficulty:

Easy
