## Description

You are given an integer array

nums

. The

absolute sum

of a subarray

[nums

l

, nums

l+1

, ..., nums

r-1

, nums

r

]

is

abs(nums

l

+ nums

l+1

+ ... + nums

r-1

+ nums

r

)

.

Return

the

maximum

absolute sum of any

(possibly empty)

subarray of

nums

.

Note that

abs(x)

is defined as follows:

If

x

is a negative integer, then

abs(x) = -x

.

If

x

is a non-negative integer, then

abs(x) = x

.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1,-3,2,3,-4]

Output:

5

Explanation:

The subarray [2,3] has absolute sum = abs(2+3) = abs(5) = 5.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [2,-5,1,-4,3,-2]

Output:

8

Explanation:

The subarray [-5,1,-4] has absolute sum = abs(-5+1-4) = abs(-8) = 8.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10

5

-10

4

<= nums[i] <= 10
